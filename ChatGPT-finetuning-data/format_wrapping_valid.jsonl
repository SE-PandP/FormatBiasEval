The film will be on in the UK on 26 October 2012 and in the United States on 9 November 2012. It has been 50 years since Sean Connery was announced as the first man to play Bond in the film named Dr No. Do you expect Skyfall which is the 23rdfilm in the 007 series? At London's Corinthi a Hotel, the official gave a little information about the storyline: Bond's loyal attitude toward his boss Miss M will be tested when one of her past staff comes back to hurt her. As MI6   is in danger, 007 needs to solve problems and protect MI6 whatever it costs. Mendes, who won a best director Oscar for 1999's American Beauty, told fans that Skyfall would have all the features of a classic Bond movie, such as a lot of action. \"Daniel Craig is back for a third time as 007 along with Dame Judi Dench as his boss Miss M.\" said Mendes. Many famous actors and actresses who have Oscar wins and nominations  are included, but the filmmakers remain keeping their roles in the film secret. Producers are showing no signs of cutting off the cost of Skyfall. \"It is at the same level as the 2008's Quantum of Solace, which cost about $200m. The film will be made in the Whitehall,  Scotland, China and Turkey, as well as Pinewood Studios.\" Said a producer. Why has 007 been popular for so long? Professor James Chapman of Leicester University, the author of the book A Cultural History of the James Bond Films, said, \"They manage to let each new film meet the changes not just in society but in the popular taste of film culture. That lets each generation get their own Bond.\" The task of James Bond in the new James Bond film is to  _  .\nAnswer choices: A. let MI6 be famous around the world | B. show off himself as a hero | C. protect MI6 when it's in trouble | D. manage the cost of Skyfall\nWrap your final answer by <ANSWER> and </ANSWER>."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<ANSWER>C</ANSWER>"}]}

Eventually she found a neighbor willing to have the tomatoes.\"Feel free to take whatever you want,\"Sharon told her. Later that day, Sharon found that her garden had indeed been harvested.

Levi Strauss hoped to sell the denim as material to make tents and covers for wagons to the men who were going to the goldfields to look for gold. \"You should have brought trousers to sell.

The miners wanted trousers that were comfortable to ride in and were low cut so that they could bend over easily to pick up the gold from under their feet. Besides they wanted the trousers to have big useful pockets. One miner complained that the gold in his pockets kept tearing them. So Levi put metal corners in the pockets to make them stronger.

Here is a list of some simple questions that you can ask your parents to see if they know the answers. Q: Why is the sky blue? A: You probably know white sunlight is made up of seven colors. While it moves in a straight line when going through space, it starts to divide as it hits \"raised area\" in the atmosphere. The ones with longest wavelengths pass through easily. The blue , however , can be taken in by the gas molecules   because it has a shorter wavelength , which in turn scatters   it in different directions. That's why when you look up at the sky, it appears to be blue. Q:Why does the moon sometimes appear during the daytime? A: The simple answer to that is because just like any other object it is being lit by the sun. As long as it is around 45 degrees or even 90 degrees off the sun, it will receive light and be able to be seen. The only time it is not able to be seen during its 28-day orbit   around the earth is when it is right between the earth and the sun. That's because its back , which is not lit by the sun, is facing us. Q: Where do birds/ honeybees go in winter? A: While the bird part is quite easy, since a lot of them get together and travel, the honeybee part is likely to puzzle your parents. It turns out that these busy insects stop being that active when the temperature drops below 50degF. Instead ,they get together in the lower central area of the hive  and form a ball around their queen. This helps keep both warm enough to survive the cold winter months. What do honeybees choose to do when the temperature drops below 50degF?\nAnswer choices: A. They choose to be active in the wild. | B. They choose to keep themselves warm. | C. They choose to travel to a warm place. | D.

Most cities can claim at least a handful of outstanding churches, palaces or houses of historical interest, but in Venice very nearly everything is remarkable, from the magnificent Piazza San Marco (St. Mark's Square ) and the palaces that line the Grand Canal to the centuries-old homes of simple fishermen. It would be easy to say that the city itself is an enormous museum if it were not for the fact it is so obviously alive. At first sight, Venice looks unbelievably permanent, an apparently complete Renaissance   city so untouched by time that there seems no reason why it should not go on forever. Now the city is slowly sinking, as the clay on which it is built loses its elasticity   and the massive wooden piles rot   away. Flooding, such a rare occurrence a hundred years ago now happens several times each winter. The damage caused by the flooding is immense, and the fabric of the ancient buildings is now being further damaged by pollution from the mainland town as well as by the wash produced by the constantly increasing number of motor boats that speed up and down the canals. A further threat to Venice comes from the Venetians themselves, some of whom are not particularly interested in preserving the city as one of the wonders of the world and would prefer to see it modernized. \"What better place is there for the meeting of dear friends? See how it glows with the advancing summer; how the sky and the sea and the rosy air and the marble of the palaces all glimmer and melt together.\" Thus wrote the famous author Henry James, of Venice, which provided the setting for his story \"The Aspern Papers\", in the nineteenth century.

Many people have been angered by the way some bankers and high officials seem to have been rewarded for failure. Others find the idea of offering many-million-dollar bonuses morally disgusting. But few have asked whether performance-related bonuses really do improve performance. The answer seems so obvious that even to ask the question can appear ridiculous. Indeed, in spite of all the complaints about them, financial encouragements continue to be introduced in more and more areas, from healthcare and public services to teaching and universities. So it may come as a shock to many to learn that paying for results can actually make people perform badly in many circumstances, and that the more you pay, the worse they perform. No one is arguing that bonuses can help companies and institutions attract and keep the best staff. Nor does anyone argue against the idea that you can encourage people to do specific tasks by linking payments to those tasks. Rather, the point is about how to get the best out of people. Do employees really perform better if you promise to pay them more for getting results? There are some obvious reasons why such payments can fail. It has been argued, for instance, that cash bonuses contributed to the financial crash, because traders had little enthusiasm to make sure that their companies enjoyed long-term survival. Most bonus projects are poorly designed, says Professor Malcolm Higgs. He thinks the reason is that organizations try to keep bonus arrangements simple. Nevertheless, he thinks bonus projects can work as long as they link the interests of individual employees with the long-term goals of a business. Bonuses can also encourage cheating. \"Once you start making people's rewards dependent on outcomes rather than behaviors, the evidence is people will do whatever they can to get those outcomes,\" says Professor Edward Deci. \"In many cases the high officials simply lied and cheated to make the stock   price go up so they got huge bonuses.\" But the work of Deci and others suggests the problem with bonuses runs far deeper than poor design or cheating. In 1971, he asked students to solve puzzles, with some receiving cash prizes for doing well and others getting nothing. Deci found those offered cash were less likely to keep working on puzzles after they had done enough to get paid. These studies suggest that offering rewards can stop people doing things for the pure joy of it. This was the basis for a series of books by Kohn in which he argues that rewarding children, students and workers with grades, scholarships and other \"bribes\"   leads to low-quality work in the long run. Those who believe in the power of bonuses fail to distinguish between inner drive and outside pressure -- wanting to do something because you like it for itself in contrast to doing something because you want the reward, Kohn says. \"It's not just that these two are different, it's often that the more you reward people for doing something, the more their inner drive tends to decline.\" A \"do this and get that\" approach might improve performance in the short term, but over longer periods it will always fail, Kohn says. People who receive bonus will naturally play safe, become less creative, cooperate less and feel less valued, he adds.

Chinese will become one of the core subjects at the 1,200-pupil college from September. At present the school has only a \"handful\" of native Chinese students, but it hopes to attract more in the future. Mr Cairns, who made the announcement in his first week as head of the high-achieving college, said, \"One of my key tasks is to make sure that the pupils at Brighton College are equipped for the realities of the 21st century, and one of those realities is that China has the fastest growing economy in the world. \"China has replaced Britain as the world's fourth-largest economy.

The television broadcaster Paula Zahn(cello) and the NBC chief White House correspondent Chuck Todd (French horn) attended college on music scholarships; Both Microsoft's Mr. Allen and the venture capitalist Rogar McNamee have rock bands. Lorry Page, a co-founder of Google, played saxophone in high school. The former World Bank president James D. Wolfensohn has played cello at Carnegie Hall. The connection isn't a coincidence. I know because I asked. I put the question to top-flight professionals in industries from tech to finance to media, all of whom had serious ( if often little-known) past lives as musicians. Almost all made a connection between their music training and their professional achievements. Will your school music program turn your kid into a Paul Allen, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft (guitar)? Or a Woody Allen (clarinet )? Probably not. These are outstanding achievers. But the way these and other visionaries   I spoke to process music is interesting. But the key question is: why does that connection exist? Paul Allen offers an answer. He says music \"establish your confidence in the ability to create.\" He began playing the violin at age 7 and switched to the guitar as a teenager. Even in the early days of Microsoft, he would pick up his guitar at the end of marathon days of programming. The music was the emotional analog   to his day job, both of them show his different creativity. He says, \"something is pushing you to look beyond what currently exists and express yourself in a new way.\" For many of the high achievers I spoke with, music functions as a \"hidden language,\" as Mr. Wolfensohn calls it, one that enhances the ability to connect different or even opposite ideas. When he ran the World Band, Mr. Wolfensohn traveled to more than 100 countries, often taking in local performances (and occasionally joining in on a borrowed cello), which helped him understand \"the culture of people\". Consider the qualities these high achievers say music has sharpened : cooperation, creativity, discipline and the capacity to coordinate   conflicting ideas. All are qualities obviously absent from public life. Music may not make you a genius, or rich, or even a better person. But it helps train you to think differently, to process different points of views --- and most important, to take pleasure in listening. Which of the following is true?\nAnswer choices: A. Everybody knows those well-known people are musicians before. | B. Musicians exist in all industries. | C. Music can certainly make you become a better person. | D.

Suddenly, Biggins, a wildlife biologist, spots a pair of eyes in the distance. Baggins can't believe his luck: He's just caught sight of a black-footed ferret  --one of the world's rarest animals. Just over a century ago, hundreds of thousands of black-footed ferrets lived on the grasslands in North America known as the prairie. But the animals died off as prairie dog disappeared. Black-footed ferret depend on prairie dogs for both food and shelter. After a ferret has eaten a prairie dog, it moves into the animal's burrow . When cattlemen started setting up ranches  on the prairie in the early 1900s, they thought prairie dogs, which eat grass, might compete with their cattle and sheep for food. To make sure that didn't happen, they killed off billions of prairie dogs. As prairie dog populations dropped, black-footed ferrets disappeared. By 1979, researchers couldn't find any ferrets and declared the species extinct. Then, two years later, a small group was discovered. Although scientists were excited about the discovery, it soon became clear that the ferrets were in danger. A disease called sylvatic plague  was killing the ferrets. Soon, just 18 ferrets remained. \"To help the species survive, the researchers put all the ferrets in cages in 1986 and began raising them,\" says Randy Matchett, a wildlife biologist. To help the black-footed ferrets learn survival skills, wildlife biologists put them through a process called preconditioning. Researchers build a fence around old prairie dog burrows and put the ferrets in them when they are a couple of months old. While the animals get used to their new home, researchers feed them live prairie dogs so they can practice hunting. \"Now about 1,000 black-footed ferrets are back in the wild. Despite their amazing comeback, black-footed ferrets aren't out of the woods yet,\" says Matchett. Sylvatic plague is still a threat, and ranchers still don't want too many prairie dogs on their land. \"We have come a long way, and we've learned a lot,\" says Matchett. \"I think if we keep working, we'll be able to help this species recover.\" How do scientists help the ferrets?\nAnswer choices: A. They take measures to stop the disease spreading. | B. They call on people to stop hunting the animals. | C. They set ferrets free when they are two months old. | D.

The cloth dolls were beautiful, but it was impossible to get the level of detail I can get with clay. First, I use wire to build the shape of the doll. Then I cover the head, hands, and feet around the wire using the cernit. Then I make the doll's clothes myself, using lots of different materials. The completed dolls are fixed onto hardwood bases made by my father, Jim Logan. Generally, the dolls I make show older people taking part in traditional activities. I've always had a great respect for the older generation. Inspiration for the dolls often comes from people I know. Once I was caught looking too closely at the wrinkles on the face of one of my mom's friends. But I explained that her laugh lines made her more attractive. Now I work as a teacher's assistant, and while I was raising my two daughters, Keri and Sheryl, I could work on the dolls only late in the day. The girls loved to come downstairs the next morning to see who'd arrived in the night. It's the detail that I enjoy working on the most. I once made a fisherman doll for a lady to give her father, including a tiny creel -- a basket used by fishermen for carrying fish. When the man got the doll, he immediately opened the creel to see what was inside. Luckily, I'd made a small fish out of cernit and placed it in the basket.

Creativity in dress The creativity comes in how parties are dressed up. Parties often have a specific theme, like a 90s party or a sports party. At a 90s party, guests might show up dressed like oncefamous celebrities. At a sports party, guests might wear their favorite team's uniforms. Held in apartments The party is usually held in the apartment of a particular outgoing friend. Everyone will be invited, which means strangers will wander in and out of the apartment where you can get to know and make some new friends. Ugly sweater party On holidays, parties frequently take on a proper theme. A popular theme around Christmas is the ugly sweater party. The goal is to wear the ugliest sweater you can find, creating an atmosphere of fun. Whatever the occasion is, there will be no shortage of _ . If you are smart enough, you won't have so much as to lose your consciousness. Parties are always better when you can remember them the next day.

Other children may have manners that are not like yours. There are all kinds of manners.    Many years ago, children who had good manners were seen and not heard. They kept quite quiet if grown-ups were talking. Today, well-mannered children have more freedom.     Sometimes good manners in one place are bad manners in other places.    Suppose you are a visitor in the land of Mongolia. Some friends ask you to eat with them. What kind of manners do they want you to have? They want you to give a loud \"burp\" after you finish eating. Burping would show that you liked your food.    In some countries, if you give a loud burp, you are told to say \"excuse me, please.\"    In many places people like to eat together. But in some parts of Polynesia it is bad manners to be seen eating at all. People show good manners by turning their backs on others while they eat. What are manners like in an East African town? The people try not to see you. They are being polite. You may see a friend. He may not see you at all. If you are polite, you will sit down beside him. You will wait until he finishes what he is doing. Then he will talk to you.    Suppose you visit a friend in Arabia. You should walk behind the other tents until you come to his tent. If you pass in front of the other tents, you will be asked into each one. The people will ask you to eat with them. And it is bad manners if you say no.    Manners are different all over the world.

There is one located on our street and it has just been completely rebuilt. I told her that they helped people book their trips and vacations. \"Why haven't we ever been in there?\" she wanted to know. \"Because we do everything ourselves online these days\" I explained. \"But why do it yourself if other people want to do it for you?\" she wondered out loud. The answer is that the travel agency makes a little bit of money on each ticket you book through them. If you book your ticket yourself, online, you save that money. Saving money sounds great except that when you think about it you typically spend three evenings comparing prices to end up saving $30 on a $300 trip. All those $30 discounts add up of course so I guess we should be happy with that. Still, how bad is it really to pay someone $30 and trust them to buy you something decent? Wouldn't you say your free evenings are worth more than $10 a piece? Consider books for a moment. Buying your book at Amazon saves you maybe 30% to 40% on each book. Add to that the convenience of shopping from home and getting the package delivered to your home address. So far so good. Unfortunately that does mean you spend way too much time browsing Amazon. com while you could do something fun instead. Like maybe reading an actual book? Then the package arrives and you aren't home and end up having to pick it up at the local post- office. All in all I wonder how much time I end up investing in the whole process. Time sounds free, but to most of us, it is more valuable than money. The Internet Economy promised to get rid of the middle-men and we loved it. Somehow, I'm starting to get the feeling that we ourselves ended up doing the work of that middle-men we were so eager to get rid of. In any project you can always pick two of these: fast, cheap or good. We seem to have focused a lot on 'cheap' and 'good' but the extra time we need to invest to keep it 'fast' comes out of our own pockets. You can always make more money but you can never make more time. What's the author's attitude towards the Internet Economy?\nAnswer choices: A. The author thinks online shopping saves time and is a convenient way to buy products. | B. The author worries about sending personal information over the internet. | C. The author doesn't think online shopping is satisfactory in every way. | D.

She seemed so small as she muscled her way through the crowd of boys on the playground. The school was across the street from our home and I would often watch the kids as they played during break. I remember the first day I saw her playing basketball. I watched in wonder as she ran circles around the other kids. She managed to shoot jump shots just over their heads and into the net. The boys always tried to stop her but no one could. I began to notice her at other times, basketball in hand, playing alone. One day I asked her why she practiced so much. Without a moment of hesitation she said, \"I want to go to college. The only way I can go is to get a scholarship. I am going to play college basketball. I want to be the best. My Daddy told me if the dream is big enough, the facts don't count.\" Well, I had to give it to her--she was determined. I watched her through those junior high years and into high school. Every week, she led her school team to victory. One day in her senior year, I saw her sitting in the grass, head in her arms. I walked across the street and sat down in the cool grass beside her. Quietly I asked what was wrong. \"Oh, nothing,\" came a soft reply, \"I am just too short.\" The coach told her that at 5'5\" she would probably never get to play for a top ranked team--much less offered a scholarship--so she should stop dreaming about college. She was heartbroken and I felt my own throat tighten as I sensed her disappointment. I asked her if she had talked to her dad about it yet. She told me that her father said those coaches were wrong. They just did not understand the power of a dream. He told her that if she truly wanted a scholarship and that nothing could stop her except one thing -- her own attitude.

Escoffier was born on October 28, 1846, in the small village of Villeneuve-Loubet, near Nice, France. Among the key figures in the boy's life was his father, who worked primarily as a blacksmith . His grandmother, an enthusiastic cook, was perhaps more responsible than anyone for introducing the boy to an appreciation of the delights of cooking. Young Escoffier attended the local school until age 12, upon which time his father thought it necessary that the boy learn a trade. In school he had shown a talent for drawing, yet he was told to regard this art only as a hobby, and to find his career in a more practical profession. Thus his father took him to Nice in 1859, where he would work as an apprentice in his uncle's restaurant, the respectable Le Restaurant Francais. At Le Restaurant Francais, Escoffier was not treated as the close relative of the boss. Rather, he experienced a classically demanding apprenticeship. For this strictness of training he would later, in his memoirs , express gratefulness. During this time Escoffier also attended night school, and had to deal with his studies as well as the demands of a promising career. When Escoffier was 19 and had taken on yet more responsibilities in his uncle's restaurant, a customer recognized his skills and offered him work in Paris. This was the owner of Le Petit Moulin Rouge, one of the finest restaurants in Paris, where Escoffier was to become a sous-chef, ranking below the head chef. After three years in this position, he rose to the level of head chef, wearing the respected chef's hat.

Unlike the man of steel, he wasn't faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than an engine and he couldn't leap tall buildings in a single bound. But the courage and determination Reeve showeed in trying to overcome his paralysis   from a 1995 horse-riding accident went beyond any of the achievements of the comic book hero. \"He became a real-life Superman. His heroism, his courage was extraordinary,\" Colin Blakemore, the chief executive of Britain's Medical Research Council said. \"Like many people who suffer some terrible injuries, Christopher Reeve was totally changed by that experience and brought the kind of energy and enthusiasm that made him successful as a film star to an entirely different issue, with huge effect.\" Reeve, 52, died of heart failure on October 10, 2004 after having treatment for an infected pressure wound without realizing his dream of walking again. But in the nine years since his accident, he made personal progress to regain respect and admiration, founded the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation, a non-profit research organization, and used his fame to raise millions of dollars for research into spinal cord injuries. He also provided hope and inspiration to other patients and made speeches to support scientists to be allowed to conduct stem cell research in the hopes of eventually curing paralysis and other illnesses such as diabetes and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. \"He has been our champion. If you think of spinal injuries, you automatically recall a picture of Christopher Reeve,\" said Paul Smith, executive director of the Spinal Injuries Association in England. It is because of Reeve that spinal cord injuries and stem cell research are so widely discussed, according to Smith. The fact that it happened to Reeve showed it can affect anyone, even Superman. Reeve did not live long enough to see whether stem cell research could help restore movement to the paralyzed. The research is still in its early days and no one knows what advances it may bring.

Why are some things funny to some people and not to others? How is that while a successful joke can cause pleasure,a sick one can cause serious harm? Over the centuries,various scholars have attempted to produce a universally agreed-upon theory of humor.Plato and Aristotle introduced the superiority  theory,the idea that people laugh at the misfortune of others.Their theory seems to explain teasing,but it doesn't work well for knock-knock jokes.Sigmund Freud argued for his relief theory,the concept that humor is a way for people to release psychological tension and reveal their inner fears and desires.His theory works well for dirty jokes,less well for most puns. The majority of humor expels today agree with the incongruity theory,the idea that humor arises when there's a gap between what people expect to happen and what actually happens.Incongruity has a lot going for it -- jokes with unexpected funny lines,for example,fit well.But scientists have found that in comedy,unexpectedness is overvalued. With the goal of developing a new,more satisfactory explanation,I produced \"the gentle violation theory\",the idea that humor arises when something seems wrong or threatening,but is actually OK or safe.A dirty joke,for example,trades on moral or social violations,but it's only going to get a laugh if the person listening is open enough to consider the subject OK to talk about.Similarly,puns can be seen as linguistic violations that still make grammatical sense. And while most humor theories have struggled to account for tickling  ,or just avoided the phenomenon altogether,my theory accounts for even this kind of laughter.Tickling involves violating someone's physical space in a gentle way.People can't tickle themselves -- because it isn't a violation.

You will find that many Canadians will smile at you as they pass in the street, or say something to you like \"Hi!\" or \"How's it going?\" Just reply with something similar. In the UK the reply would be \"I'm fine\", but in Canada they say \"I'm good\". In company, when someone is offering you a second helping of food or more wine, if you don't want any more, use the same expression-- \"I'm good\". In this case, it means \"No, thank you. I've had enough\". Most Canadians don't press you to eat more than you want. In restaurant, your plate will be cleared away almost immediately you have finished eating. When you go into a shop or store, the shop assistant asks you how you are or if they can help you, it is their way of being friendly and making conversation with the customers. Canadians eat early and go home early. When you are invited to a Canadian's home, you may be asked to arrive at 5:30 pm or 6 pm. But guests in Europe don't expect to arrive until 7:30 pm or 8 pm. Remember to take off your shoes and leave them inside the door without being asked. It's not a religious custom, but it's practical. In winter, there can be a lot of snow and dirt on your shoes, once you are in the warm house it melts and falls off, making a mess. Canadians tend to have light colored carpets or hardwood floors.

Nothing lives alone. Most animals must live in a group, and even a plant grows close together with others of the same kind. Sometimes one living thing kills another, one eats and the other is eaten. Each kind of life eats another kind of life in order to live, and together they create a food chain  . Some food chains are simple, while others are not. But all food chains begin with the sun, and all food chains become broken up if one of the links   disappears. All life needs sunlight to live on. But only plants can use sunlight directly. Plants are 'factories'. They make food from sunlight, water and things in the soil   and air. Plants feed all other living things. Animals can only use the sun's energy after it has been changed into food by plants. Some animals feed directly on plants, others eat smaller animals. Meat-eating animals are only eating plants indirectly. What about humans? We are members of many food chains. We eat rice, vegetables, and fruits and so on. We also eat meat and drink milk. But we often break up the food chains. We kill wild animals and also make rivers, lakes and seas polluted. When these rivers, lakes and seas are polluted, the fish in them can not be eaten. If we eat the fish, we will get strange illnesses. Each form of life is linked   to all others. Breaking the links puts all life in danger. Who often destroy the food chains?\nAnswer choices: A.

With the shops so crowded and the staff so busy, it does not require any extraordinary talent to help you to take one or two little things and escape unnoticed. It is known, in the business, as \"hoisting\". But the hoisting game is not what it used to be. Even at the height of the sales, shoplifters today never know if they are being watched by one of those evil little balls that hang from the ceilings of so many department stores above the most desirable goods. As if that was not trouble enough for them, they can now be filmed at work and forced to attend a showing of their performance in court. Selfridges was the first big London store to install videotape equipment to watch its sales floors. In October last year the store won its first court case for shoplifting using an evidence a videotape clearly showing a couple stealing dresses. It was an important test case which encouraged other stores to install similar equipment. When the balls first make an appearance in shops, it was widely believed that their only function was to frighten shoplifters. Their somewhat ridiculous appearances, the curious holes and red lights going on and off, certainly make the theory believable. It did not take long, however, for serious shoplifters to start showing suitable respect. Soon after the equipment was in operation at Selfridges, store detective Brian Chadwick was sitting in the control room watching a woman secretly putting bottles of perfume into her bag. \"As she turned to go,\" Chadwick recalled, \"she suddenly looked up at the 'balls' and stopped. She could not possibly have seen that the camera was trained on her because it is completely hidden, but she must have had a feeling that I was looking at her.\" \"For a moment she paused, but then she returned to counter and started putting everything back. When she had finished, she opened her bag towards the camera to show it was empty and hurried out of the store.\" The case last October was important because   _   .\nAnswer choices: A. the store got the dresses back | B. the equipment was able to frighten shoplifters | C. other shops found out about the equipment | D. the kind of evidence supplied was accepted by court\nWrap your final answer in italics by enclosing it with single asterisks."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "*D*"}]}

They worry because they can't remember words. In fact, the problem usually isn't with their memory. The problem is with how they study. To remember words better, you need to understand how memory works. There are two kinds of memory: short-term and long-term. When you see, hear, or read something, it goes first into short-term memory. But short-term memory lasts for only a few seconds. You will only remember something longer if it goes into long-term memory. Y _ . How can you do this with vocabulary? The answer is to work with the word and think about the word in new ways. You can do this by writing new sentences that include it. Even better, you can invent a little story about the word, with people or places that you know. Another way is to make a picture in your mind with the word. For example, if the word is height, you can think of the tallest person you know and try to guess his or her height. All of these activities are good ways to think about words. They make the meaning of words stronger in your long-term memory. And they give a way to find a word when you need it. In the writer's opinion, students can't remember words because   _  .\nAnswer choices: A. they have memory problems | B. they are too worried | C. they don't use a proper way | D. they don't like to study\nWrap your final answer in italics by enclosing it with single asterisks."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "*C*"}]}

Peer pressure   can be direct or indirect, but it is almost always present. Learning to deal with peer pressure makes a teen mature  , and able to get along well with others. Bad peer pressure is when teens feel pressured to do something that they know is wrong, such as smoking, drinking, or drugs  , and it can remain   with them into adulthood. This is the main reason teens have to learn how to deal with it. Some of the things you can do to deal with peer pressure include: * Choose friends who share your values. Good friends use positive   peer pressure to help you be your best self. * Keep away from situations where people are doing things you don't want to do. * Think about your reasons for doing things. Are they good reasons? Are you being true to yourself and your values? * Practice ways of saying no, giving excuses if necessary. * Talk to your parents, or other trusted adults, about the kinds of peer pressure you face, and listen to their advice. * Let the adults know when you need help to get out of a bad situation, and don't know what to do about it.

Their lives and works are connected with the lonely moors of Yorkshire, England, where they lived. Patrick Bronte, the sisters' father, was a poor Irishman who became the parish clergyman of the small, isolated town of Haworth, Yorkshire. Bronte was somewhat strange and tended to be strict. His wife died in 1821 and her sister brought up the family out of duty, but with little love or understanding. The sisters went to several boarding schools where they received a better education than usual for girls at that time, but in a bad atmosphere. Few jobs were available for women at that time, and the Bronte sisters, except for occasional jobs as governesses or schoolteachers, lived their entire lives at home. They were shy, poor, and lonely, and occupied themselves with music, drawing, reading and ---above all---writing. Their isolation led to the early development of their imaginations. In 1846, under the male pen names of Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell, the sisters published a joint volume of poems.Although only two copies were sold, all three sisters soon had their first novels published. Charlotte Bronte's most famous novel Jane Eyre (1847) is largely _ . Through the heroine, Charlotte relived her hated boarding school life and her experiences as a governess in a large house. Rochester, the hero and master of the house, is fictional. Jane Eyre was enormously successful, but many readers were shocked that Rochester, who tried to make Jane his mistress, should be rewarded by marrying her. Some readers were also shocked because Jane wanted to be regarded as a thinking and independent person, rather than as a weak female. Charlotte Bronte wrote three other novels. The first one, The Professor, was not published until 1857, after her death. Shirley (1849) is set among the labour riots of the early 1800s. Villette (1853) the most popular of the three, is based on Charlotte's unhappy experiences as a governess in Brussels. We can infer from the passage that   _  .\nAnswer choices: A. the three sisters were badly treated by their step-mother | B. The three Bronte sisters were brought up in Ireland | C. Haworth was suffering high unemployment at the time of the three Bronte sisters | D. writing was not intended for women in the 19th century in Britain\nWrap your final answer in italics by enclosing it with single asterisks."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "*D*"}]}

But in the US, a mom makes a cupcake for her children on their birthday. Cupcakes are small, round cakes topped with frosting  . It has been an American tradition that moms bring cupcakes to the classroom to celebrate their child's birthday. But recently some doctors have called for this to be banned. They believe cupcakes contribute to child obesity. Despite their good intentions, however, some people believe that experts are interfering   with American culture. The cupcake is seen as American as apple pie -- only prettier. According to Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition at New York University, the cupcake is the most democratic   of desserts. As they are small enough for one person, you don't have to share your cupcake with anyone -- it's all yours. They are also all the same size, so there can't be any cries of \"she got the bigger piece!\" Each bite can taste different depending on how much icing you have. It is a lesson in self-determination. Some people eat only a little of the frosting every time, others have it all in just one bite. In recent years, eating a cupcake has become as _ as having a cup of Starbucks coffee. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton jokingly promised on a talk show that if she was elected president, she would give everyone a cupcake on her birthday.

This information helps us prepare ourselves for any problem in the future. Current affairs   serve different purposes for different people. Theses days, the importance of current affairs has risen. Most people focus on certain areas of information according to their needs and interests. There are certain areas like science and technology, which attract only a special kind of crowd, and thus have a lesser audience compared to fields like the entertainment industry.          Science and technology are completely ignored   by a common man, unless he or she happens to be \"a techno-freak  \". Yes, this is the word given to people who show interest in current affairs related to science and technology. However, they are the ones who have much more knowledge of the current world.

It is the techno-freaks that cause the development in science and technology, and thanks to them you can see a miracle of new inventions. The old way of living has been replaced by the high-tech modern way of living. It will be a world of robots in the near future.

Many parts of the old machines are reused, and only the parts that can't be used are thrown away. The government also charges  a rubbish bag tax . If people want their rubbish to be collected, they must buy yellow stickers  and put them on their rubbish bags. In 2003, 47% of all rubbish in the cities was recycled. This included 70% of paper, 95%of glass, 71%of plastic bottles and 85--90%of cans. Until recently, people could get a small amount of money when they recycled their bottles. Recycling has become a daily habit for the Swiss. Everyone should learn from the Swiss, and our country will be clean like Switzerland. The best title of the article is  _  .\nAnswer choices: A.

Activities are planned in more than 20 countries to get millions of people in the developing world to wash their hands with soap. For example, donors  will give 150,000 bars of soap to schools in Ethiopia. Experts say people around the world wash their hands every day, but very few use soap at so-called important moments. These include after using the toilet, after cleaning a baby and before touching food. Global Handwashing Day is the idea of the Public-Private Partnership for Handwashing with Soap. Partners include the United Nations Children's Fund, American government agencies, the World Bank and soap makers Unlever and Procter and Gamble. The organizers say all soaps are equally effective at removing disease-causing germ . They say the correct way to wash is to wet your hands with a small amount of water and cover them with soap. Rub  it into all areas, including under the fingernails . Rub for at least twenty seconds. Then _ well under running water. Finally, dry your hands with a clean cloth or wave them in the air. The Partnership for Handwashing says soap is important because it increases the time that people spend in washing hands. Soap also helps to break up the dirt that holds most of the germs. And it usually leaves a pleasant smell. The Partnership for Handwashing also says washing with soap before eating or after using the toilet could save more lives than any vaccine or medicine. Hand washing could also prevent the spread of other diseases. When people get germs on their hands, they can infect themselves by touching their eyes, noses or mouths. Then they can infect others.

A visit to Universal Studios brings back memories of great days of Hollywood, the films and the stars. But they are only memories. Hollywood isn't quite the same as it used to be. Costs have gone up and confidence has gone down. Movie-makers are afraid to spend their money on expensive new ideas. Instead, they repeat old ones. The film industry is changing fast. Teenagers still go out to the movies. The theatre is a good place to meet friends away from home. But older people mostly stay home to watch series, like Dynasty have become as important to Hollywood as expensive movies. These \"soap opera\", as they are called, show rich, powerful families living in beautiful homes and wearing beautiful clothes. But the actors and actresses are nearly all middle-aged, like many of the people who watch them. Though it is soap operas that are keeping the film-makers of Hollywood in Business, big films are still being made in America. But more and more of them are made outside Hollywood.   New York is the most important new center, but there are many others as well. Movie-makers have realized that they don't need Hollywood any more. Modern cameras and real houses instead of expensively made copies in a studio. Other states, especially Florida and Texas, are working hard to take the film business away from California.

I left, and in a few hours returned to find a mess in the kitchen, front room, and both children sitting in front of the television. Having had a long day, I was very short with my greeting to them and then I noticed the material my daughter had used. It had been bought to make a baby blanket, and now had chunks cut out of almost every piece of cloth. Not stopping to listen, I  _ at the children and explained how angry I was at what had been done. My daughter listened to me sheepishly, not trying to defend herself at all, but the pain could be seen written across her face. She went back to her room quietly, and spent some time in there alone before she came out to say good night and once again apologize for the mistake she had made.

By 2025, as many as 250,000 self-driving vehicles could be sold each year globally, according to a study by an industry research firm. \"Vehicles that can take anyone from A to B at the push of a button could transform mobility for millions of people,\" said Chris Urmson, director of Google's self-driving car project. For now, Google has no plans to sell any of its self-driving cars. They are strictly for research. But they will hit public roads this summer near Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California. Previous testing has taken place only on closed courses. The cars are built to operate without a steering wheel, accelerator   or brake pedal. \"Our software and sensors do all the work,\" Urmson said. \"The vehicles will be very basic -- we want to learn from them and adapt them as quickly as possible -- but they will take you where you want to go at the push of a button.\" The prototype   are the first of a 100-car fleet the tech giant is building. In the long run, Urmson sees a future of safer roads -- the majority of auto accidents are caused by human error -- and fewer traffic jams. Robotic cars could also shuttle people who can't drive because of age or illness.  Google has said that self-driving cars could launch new business models in which people buy the use of vehicles they don't own. The company has already tested other types of self-driving cars on public streets, including modified Lexus sport-utility vehicles, under a special permit program by the California Department of Motor Vehicles that requires a human driver at the controls. The state has issued six other companies permits to operate such cars, including Delphi, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen, Tesla, Bosch and Nissan. The vehicles that will be tested on open roads this summer will have removable steering wheels, accelerators and brake pedals to allow \"safety drivers\" to take control if needed. Google says the cars are safe. The vehicles have sensors that \"can detect objects out to a distance of more than two football fields in all directions, which is especially helpful on busy streets with lots of intersections,\" Urmson said. \"We're looking forward to learning how the community understands and interacts with the vehicles, and to uncovering challenges that are unique to a fully self-driving vehicle,\" Urmson said.

Hugh Grant bumps   into Julia Roberts and spills   orange juice all over her. After the _ , Grant repeatedly says: \" I am so sorry. I am so sorry.\" His actions in this scene are very British. If Roberts' character were from Britain then she would probably apologize repeatedly as well--even if the crash were not her fault. But this doesn't happen in the film, as Roberts is from the US. A report in The Telegraph last week said that three-quarters of British people apologize when they bump into someone in the street -- regardless of whether they are responsible or not. In fact, we Britons use \"sorry\" in many situations. For example, if we mishear someone, we say \"Sorry?\" The person we are talking to will also apologize by replying: \"No, I am sorry!\" This can go on for up to five minutes as we compete over who is the most sorry. Life is never as simple as \"duibuqi\" and \"meiguanxi\". How we use \"sorry\" has changed. Traditionally, \"sorry\" was used to express deep regret, but a survey in 2007 showed that we use it to mean anything from \"what\" to \"whatever\". Why are Britons so sorry? Mark Tyrell, a psychology writer in the UK, thinks about our apologetic tendencies are rooted in the British class system. We say sorry because historically the new middle classes in Britain had to apologize for not being working class, but also for not really being upper class. Another theory is that we apologize to avoid confrontation . For example, if you bump into someone they might get angry. To avoid this we instantly say \"Sorry!\". True manners are about being considerate and the modern day obsession with apologizing show that we are perhaps not as thoughtful as we once were. The word has lost some of its meaning. Do you see my point? Sorry, it might just be a British thing... Which of the following might Mark Tyrell agree to?\nAnswer choices: A. British people are sincere while saying sorry. | B.

Each passage is followed by several questions or unfinished statements. For each of them there are four choices marked A, B, C and D. Choose the one that fits best according to the information given in the passage. Britons stranded at sea or in flooded homes could find a real-life prince riding to their rescue. Prince William announced on Monday that he is to train to be a full-time pilot with the Royal Air Force's Search and Rescue Force (SARF). William, who is currently a Lieutenant in the Army's Household Cavalry Regiment , will transfer to the RAF and begin an 18-month training course in January 2009. If successful, he will become a fully operational Search and Rescue pilot in 2010, flying Sea King helicopters at one of the six SARF units based in Britain. \"The time I spent with the RAF earlier this year made me realize how much I love flying,\" the prince, who spent two weeks with a SARF team while on work experience in 2005, said in a statement. \"Joining Search and Rescue is a perfect opportunity for me to serve in the Forces operationally, while contributing to a vital part of the country's Emergency Services.\" It means he will follow a similar career to that of his uncle, Prince Andrew, who was a Sea King helicopter pilot during the 1982 Falklands war. The Search and Rescue teams' main duty is to recover RAF personnel but in peacetime they mainly respond to civilian emergencies, dealing with more than 1,000 calls a year. The units deal with incidents ranging from helping those trapped by sudden major floods to rescuing people lost while out walking on hills. William, who has spent the last year on secondment to the various branches of the military to prepare for his future role as head of the armed forces, received his RAF wings  following a four-month stint with the service earlier this year. However, his time with the RAF was clouded when the Defense Ministry was forced to fend off criticism for allowing the prince to fly military helicopters to a bachelor party for his cousin and to the family home of his girlfriend Kate Middleton.

The new study shifts attention to the other end of the thermometer . The exciting thing is the idea of pushing the window of acceptable bacterial environments a little bit farther open. Researchers have previously collected small numbers of bacteria from ice in Antarctica and Greenland, but they could not determine whether these were active bacteria or just frozen cells blown in by wind. In contrast, the earth beneath two Swiss glaciers harbors large colonies of bacteria--hundreds of millions of cells per gram--that appear to be growing at 0degC. Scientists followed upon these findings by taking samples of ice, water, and earth at two mountain glaciers. They found that earth beneath the glaciers contained much larger populations of bacteria than did surface and inner part of ice. Those findings indicate that the bacteria were growing at the bottom of the glacier and are not something washed in while the scientists drilled through the ice. Looking at the bacteria under a microscope , the researchers found that many were in the process of dividing, and healthy under the ice. The bacteria might break down minerals and plant remains originally buried beneath the glacier or later washed in by water going slowly through the ice, scientists say. \"Some of the assumptions we have made in the past now must be seriously questioned,\" say researchers. \"If bacteria can live under glaciers on Earth, why not on other planets? The new study points out in many ways that the bottoms of glaciers are probably quite good environments from the point of view of bacteria. So, maybe the bottom of the ice sheets on other planets would be a sensible place to try if you're going to look for life on them.\" The passage is mainly about the possibility of the existence of life   _  .\nAnswer choices: A. under the sea | B. in hot water | C. on other planets | D. under glaciers\nWrap your final answer using double square brackets."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "[[D]]"}]}

I exited the freeway and turned onto College Drive. I only had to drive another quarter mile down the road to the college. But just then my car died and wouldn't start again.

Alex wanted to help more people. He decided to donate to Heifer International, an organization that gives farm animals and farm training to poor people around the world. His goal: $5,000 for a \"gift ark\". That amount would mean that 15 pairs of animals would be given to people in need. Those families would agree to give one of their animals' young to other needy families. Alex decided that baking was the best way to raise money.

I was a farm boy from County Kilkenny, a child who some thought would never walk, let alone go as far as I had in the world. From the day I was born, there was a problem. The doctors at the Dublin hospital told my parents I had phocomelia, a _ that affected both legs below the knee, which were outward and shorter than normal and each foot had just three toes. Life was tough. I couldn't stand, much less walk. I rarely, left the farmhouse---and then only in someone's arms. Mam bundled me up whenever she took me to town, no matter the season. \"The world will see him when he can walk,\" she told Dad. \"And he will walk.\" Mam devoted herself to helping me. She tried everything to get me on my feet. When I was three, she and Dad took me to a clinic in Dublin. A few weeks later we returned to Dublin with my artificial limbs  . Back home I practiced walking with my new limbs. \"There's nothing anyone can do but you can't,\" Mam said. \"You and I are going to walk through town.\" The next day Mam dressed me in my finest clothes. She wore a summer dress and fixed her hair and makeup. Dad drove us to the church. We stepped out of the car. Mam took my hand. \"Hold your head up high, now, Ronan,\" she said. We walked 300 meters to the post office. It was the farthest I'd walked, and I was sweating from the effort. Then we left the post office and continued down the street, Mam's eyes shining with a mother's pride. That night, back on our farm, I lay exhausted on my bed. It meant nothing, though, compared to what I'd done on my walk. Then I began to pursue my dream of singing. And at every step Mam's words came back to me--Ronan, you can do anything anyone else can do--and the faith she had in God, who would help me do it. I've sung from the grandest stages in Europe, to music played by the world's finest musicians. That night, I stood at the Madison Square Garden, with Mam's words chiming in my ears. Then I began singing. I couldn't feel the pulse of the music in my feet, but I felt it deep in my heart, the same place where Mam's promise lived.

Meet Judy Williams. When she and her husband recently checked into Blu Hotel in Zurich, a clerk asked them to sign the dotted line on a room rate hundreds of dollars higher than their online offer. \"It was not a cheap stay,\" says Williams, a lawyer from Billings, Mont. But it became more of one after her husband fired up the Booking.com app he'd used to book their room on his smart phone. \"As soon as we showed him the cost, he honored it,\" Williams says. Technology may create challenges for travelers but it can also solve them. It's more than making sure of a hotel cost. The latest Booking.com can help users select hotels by location, make a secure booking and view the confirmed   cost so they never need to re-discuss their hotel price. Another pain point for travelers is traffic that eats away precious vacation time. There's a new app called Commute which is aimed at users who have to make the same trip every day. But if you're headed to Los Angeles or Honolulu, where visitors can easily get stuck in hours of heavy traffic, Commute can help. Just input basic information about your destination and expected leaving time, and the app will start sending you traffic information 15 minutes before you leave. Testing Commute proved to be a challenge for me, because my home address is about 900 miles from my place of work. But if you have only a short distance to travel through a heavily populated area, you can use Commute to avoid traffic jams. Another source of travel-related problems is money. That's particularly true when you're dealing with a foreign currency. The latest Travel Money Tracker helps travelers prevent currency mix-ups. It immediately changes a country's native currency to yours, so you know exactly how much that Espresso   in Milan costs in dollars. It can also warn you when you're overspending, which can sometimes be a problem when you're on vacation. The only catch, of course, is that you have to remember to record all your purchases. Taken together, these apps solve some of the most common travel problems. But not all of them. Some things, no smart phone can fix, which means I get to keep my job - for now at least.

It's all too easy to blame someone else for the water situation -\"if 70% of water is used for agriculture then that's what we should target\" - but it's not that easy. We all depend on the food and resources that agriculture provides, and while there are definitely opportunities to increase water efficiency on the farm, the solution will take more than that. We each share responsibility for the sustainable management of our water resources, which means using less water at home, in the workplace, at school, on holidays, on the farm, ... everyone, everywhere, every time. It's time to become water efficient! This involves reassessing our relationship with water, and learning to use it more sparingly. On the most basic level, it requires a behavioural  change, and assigning a value to water that truly reflects its worth. We can also unlock economic benefits of being water efficient. There are many real world examples given in the case studies on this site. Everybody has a responsibility to save water, if future generations are to enjoy a similar standard of living to the one we enjoy now. In fact, many of the impacts associated with water use are likely to have an effect on our own lives! www.savewater.com.au has been designed to help you respond to the challenge to become water efficient. It acts as a central repository for relevant information and further advice, so that you can actually achieve significant savings. It also showcases those companies with products that will assist you in your goal. What is not the reason to save water?\nAnswer choices: A. There are more and more people in the world. | B. The water resources are limited. | C. Agriculture needs more water. | D.

A new study has found that restaurant goers who pay more for their meals think the food is tastier than offered for a smaller price. The experts think that people tend to associate cost with quality and this changes their perception  of how food tastes. Scientists at Cornell University studied the eating habits of 139 people enjoying an Italian buffet in a restaurant. The price of the food was set by the researchers at either $4 or $8 for the all-you-can-eat meal. Customers were asked to rate how good the food tasted, the quality of the restaurant and to leave their names. The experiment showed that the people who paid $8 enjoyed their meal 11% more than those who ate the \"cheaper\" buffet. Interestingly those that paid for the $4 buffet said they felt guiltier about loading up their plates and felt that they overate. However, the scientists said that both groups ate around the same quantity of food in total. Brian Wansink, a professor of consumer behavior at the university, said: \"We were fascinated to find that pricing has little effect on how much one eats, but a huge effect on how you interpret the experience.\" He thinks that people enjoyed their food more as they associated cost with quality and that small changes to a restaurant can change how tasty people find their meals. In a previous study, researchers from the university showed that people who eat in bright lighting consume more than people who eat in less brightly lit areas.

There are now no red squirrels left in an area of more than 1,150 square kilometres (sq km) in Piedmont, according to research from the universities of Turin, Genoa and Varese. On the edge of this large region, the species is also under threat from the invasions of grey squirrels. If the spread of the grey squirrel continues uncontrolled, the species could spread as far as France, the scientists fear. They are calling for more research and control and conservation measures aimed at preserving the remaining red squirrel populations and containing the spread of the greys. Grey squirrels were introduced into Italy  ly recently, in 1948. They were a gift from the US ambassador and kept in Turin, but escaped into the wild and rapidly colonized the surrounding area - despite warnings from the UK, where importing grey squirrels was forbidden from before the Second World War, when the destructive effects of having imported greys in the 1880s had become clear. Grey squirrels are not only more aggressive than the native European red squirrel, which causes them to invade red-dominated areas and take over, but they also carry a deadly virus, the squirrel pox. While greys are largely immune to the virus, it is deadly to red squirrels, which typically die within one or two weeks of being infected. From only four animals in 1948, at Stupinigi near Turin, the greys spread rapidly in recent years. Until 1970 the distribution of greys was limited to the Stupinigi woods, occupying an area of about 12 sq km. By 1990 this area had expanded to more than 200 sq km, stretching mainly southwards into the Cuneo province. By 2000, grey squirrels occupied 900 sq km and this year, fresh research from the three universities shows that their distribution now extends to more than 2,000 sq km. In more than half of that area, the native reds have been entirely wiped out, and in the remainder they are under severe threat.

Electronics, such as laptops, mislead our minds into thinking that it is still daytime, preventing sleep and increasing the risk of _ . Sleep experts say human's natural body clock begins to rest and relax from the day between 9 and 10 pm but the use of computers confuses it. A person's brain biologically becomes awake when the sun is out because bright light after dark causes the brain to stop producing the hormone   called melatonin that makes us sleepy. Researchers say blue light from devices such as iPads, which is expected to become a popular reading tool when it comes out later this month, is particularly disruptive  during the night when the brain thinks it should be dark. Experts say a good book is a far better way of resting the brain and ensuring a good night's sleep because the bedside lamp  light doesn't affect the brain as it does not look straight into a person's eyes. \"Potentially, yes, if you're using an iPad or a laptop close to bedtime... that light can be stimulating   to the brain to make it more awake and delay your ability to sleep,\" Phyllis Zee, a professor at Northwestern University and director of the school's Centre for Sleep & Circadian Biology, told CNN. \"And I think more importantly, it could also be enough to affect your circadian   rhythm.

It is a particular problem in richer countries with sleep experts linking it to the use of mobile phones and computers in bedroom late at night. Sleep deprivation is such a serious problem that lessons have to be dragged down to a lower level to suit sleep-deprived learners, the study found. The international comparison, carried out by Boston College, found the United States to have the highest number of sleep-deprived students, with 73% of 9- and 10-year-olds and 80% of 13- and 14-year-olds identified by their teachers as being negatively affected. In literacy  tests there were 76% of 9- and 10-year-olds lacking sleep. This was much higher than the international average of 47% of primary pupils needing more sleep and 57% among the secondary age group. Other countries with the most sleep-deprived youngsters were New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Australia, England, Ireland and France. High-performing Finland is also among the most lacking in sleep. Countries with the best records for getting enough sleep include Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Portugal, the Czech Republic, Japan and Malta. The analysis was part of the huge date-gathering process for global education rankings, the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study(TIMSS)and Progress in International Reading Literacy Study(PIRLS) \"I think we underestimate the impact of sleep. Our data show that across countries internationally, on average, children who have more sleep achieve higher in maths, science and reading. That is exactly what our data show,\" says Chad Minnich of the TIMSS and PIRLS International Study Center. \"It's the same link for children who are lacking basic nutrition,\" says Mr Minnich, based at the Lynch School of Education, Boston College. \"If you are unable to concentrate, to attend mentally, you are unable to achieve at your best level, because your mind and body are in need of something more basic. Sleep is a fundamental need for all children. If teachers report such large proportions of children suffering from lack of sleep, it's having a significant impact. But worse than that, teachers are having to adjust their instruction based on those children who are suffering from a lack of sleep.

Still, many child-development experts agree that tying a child's allowance to chores can be a slippery slope. Here's why. Susie Walton, master instructor at Peace in Your Home advises to keep chores and allowances totally separate. \"Allowance is one thing. When it comes to chores, life skills, responsibilities-that's a whole different thing.\" says Walton. Walton says, \"When kids aren't doing a chore, you don't say, 'well, there goes your allowance.' You're going to sit them down and ask what's going on. 'We are a team. We are a family. We've got to have them done.'\" Besides, by paying children for chores with an allowance, you'll also be sending the message that work isn't worth doing unless they're getting paid for it. There are times when it would make sense to pay kids for chores. Most financial and child-development experts agree that it's a fine idea to pay children money for extra jobs that are outside their normal set of chores, such as washing windows, washing the car or helping to clean out the garage-especially if the child is saving for a big item. This may even develop an entrepreneurial   spirit to think outside of the box to earn money. For parents who are concerned that their children won't learn the value of a dollar if the allowance isn't tied to household chores, note that there are still plenty of money management skills to be learned from a straight allowance. Depending on the age, kids can be made responsible for paying for their own toys or snacks. Some parents even require that kids set aside a percentage of their allowance toward savings. \"I really like having my own money,\" says Kevin, 9. \"It's up to me if I want to buy the cheap toy now, or save and get the better toy.\" And that's a good lesson to learn at 9 years old. No matter which allowance route you take in parenthood, kids will feel empowered by being able to handle their own money.

His life with her was full of great happiness, as he wrote in his diary: \"My own happiness in the past often approached such joy that I could not share it even with the person dearest to me but had to walk it away in quiet streets and take down parts of it in my diary.\" This Side of Paradise, his first novel, was published in 1920. Encouraged by its success, Fitzgerald began to devote more time to his writing. Then he continued with the novel The Beautiful and Damned (1922), a collection of short storiesTales of the Jazz Age(1922), and a play The Vegetable (1923). But his greatest success wasThe Great Gatsby, published in 1925, which quickly brought him praise from the literary world. Yet it failed to give him the needed financial security.

Some companies have also delay new oil drilling and exploration projects. The drop in oil prices has also affected small service companies and even stores that do business with oil companies in big producer states like Texas. But the drop in oil prices has not been bad for everyone.  Oil platform workers are often called roughnecks. In Texas, many roughnecks have lost their jobs because of the drop in oil prices. The effect of falling prices has been worse in states like Alaska and North Dakota. That is because production costs are higher there than they are in the Eagle Ford area of south-central Texas.  Adam Perdue is an economist at the University of Houston's Institute for Regional Forecasting. He has been studying the effect of falling oil prices in Texas. He says oil company exploration and production budgets  are being cut between 10 and 50 percent, with most of them being cut by a third. He thinks the lower spending will affect the local economy. The economic slowdown will affect companies that manufacture pipes and other equipment for oil exploration and production. It will also have an effect on trucking companies that supply sand and chemicals, and other small businesses that serve the energy industry. But low oil prices are good for chemical companies. They use hydrocarbons  found in oil to make fertilizer, plastic and other products. Adam Perdue says a new chemical plant project near Houston will provide jobs for many skilled workers \"A lot of these roughnecks that are gonna lose their jobs out there in the field are gonna be able to come home and, and, and get a welding job or a construction job.\" he says.

Suppose, for example, that we wish to find out the height of the water-tower, AB, in a factory. We first of all go to where the water-tower is standing and measure a distance of, say, 25 feet from it. Then we take a stick, and stand it in the ground at the spot we have just marked. Let us suppose the stick we are using is 4 feet in height. We now walk farther away from the water -tower in the same straight line as when we measured off the distance of 25 feet. We go from the water-tower until we come to point E, where with our head on the ground, we see the top of the stick and the top of the water-tower in the same height line---that is, the top of the stick just covers the highest part of the water-tower. Every schoolboy can work out the height of the water-tower now. Suppose that the line CE is five feet. We know that the stick is 4 feet high and the distance BE is 30 feet.

She worked at several lower-paid jobs, relocated to a new city and even declared bankruptcy. Then in December, she finally moved back into her parents' home at age 52. \"I'm back living in the bedroom that I grew up in,\" she said.    Taking shelter with parents isn't uncommon for young people, especially when the job market is poor. But now the declining economy is forcing some children to do so later in life---even at middle age.    Financial planners report receiving many calls from parents seeking advice about taking in their grown children after divorces and lay-offs. Kim Erickson, a financial planner in California, said she has never seen older children, even those at 50, depending so much on their parents as in the last six months. \"These are 40-and-50-year-old children of my clients that they're helping out. We have a hard time saying no as a culture to our children, and they keep asking for more,\" she said.    Bauer's parents won't take rent money. She's trying to save several hundred dollars a month for a house while working as a meeting coordinator. Bauer would prefer to live on her own, but without her parents' help, she would \"probably be renting again,\" she said. \"Buying groceries for another person isn't stretching my budget too much,\" said her mother, Shirley Smith, aged 80.    Parents usually feel guilty if they don't offer help. But a large number of  well-meaning parents must delay retirement or scale back their dreams because they have to help their children, Erickson said. And the sliding economy might threaten their jobs.    \"I almost have to act like a financial therapist,\" she said to Shirley. \"Here is the line I'm drawing for you. That's fine. You can do up to this point, but at this point, now you're starting to erode (  ) your own wealth.\" What is the main idea of the passage?\nAnswer choices: A. American culture has an effect on the relationship between parents and children. | B. Children's dependence on their parents is increasing. | C.

They are rarely over five feet six, or 120 pounds. The lighter the weight on the horse, the faster it can go. Riding fast horses on the track is tough on the small jockeys. The jockey doesn't\"sit\"on the horse. He leans forward on his legs. The strain is on his thighs  and calf  muscles. As jockeys age, their legs\"go\"first. Jockeys also need arm strength. It's a strain holding a 1000-pound racehorse. On muddy days, jockeys get a pounding of mud. The mud comes flying off the hooves  of the horses in front. \"It feels like someone is punching you all over,\"says one rider. And a jockey can be hurt. A jockey can have a leg jammed between two horses. Or it can get caught between horse and the rail. The worst accidents are from falls. A horse may fall on his rider. Or horses behind may trample if he hits the track. In one year about 240 riders are hurt badly. That's one out of six jockeys. But the jockeys are well-paid. A jockey keeps about ten percent of the money his horses win. Jacinto Vasquez, a five-foot-three comer, has ridden horses to $7,000,000 in wins in the last eight years, which means he does almost $100,000 a year. Why do some jockeys do better than others? \"It isn't the way a boy sits on a horse or uses the reins or the whip,\"says Conn McCreary. McCreary was a top jockey of the 1950's. He rode two Kentucky Derby winners. \"Most jockeys do this the same. It's the 'feel' he has for the horses.\" \"When you come right down to it, it just seems that horses run better for some riders,\" McCreary says. \"A real good jockey doesn't lose with the best horse.

Here are a few gems   that I use now or plan to use in the future with my two boys. Here's how a conversation often went when I was a kid. Usually it was around 4:30 p.m. I said, \"I'm hungry. Can I have a cookie?\" My mom answered, \"No. Have a banana.\" \"I don't want a banana.\" \"Then you're not hungry.\" Sometimes I was angry about it, but I knew that was good for me. Thanks mom for not letting me eat junk food  . Now I agree with my mother and I have this same conversation with my three-year-old son. I hope it helps him form healthy diet habits. I know many of us heard this as children. \"If everyone jumped off a bridge, would you do it, too?\" If our kids asked for something just because everyone else had it or was doing it, we often got this response. It was the perfect response, and we soon learned not to ask for things because everyone else had it, but because it was something we wanted. I will always be thankful that my parents let us try the things that interested us, not the things they wanted to push us into. This helped me try swimming, dance, and the piano before second grade. I found a love -- singing -- and kept up with that through my college years.

Thus about 30% of today's food budget goes on meals eaten outside the home while a hundred years ago it was only 3%.           At the beginning of the 20th century, few people owned their homes (only around 19% of working families )and cars (at $ 1,000 per car this was well above the average family income of $ 650 per year) , as most people were unable to borrow money. But there was a rapid rise in both home and car ownership during the mid-1900s.           Free time increased considerably following the shortening of the working week, i. e. from six days to five ,and from ten hours to eight hours a day. In fact, the working day couldn't be too long, otherwise people wouldn't have the time to spend their money. The amount of a family's budget spent on outside entertainment ,such as parties, films and concerts has increased from just under 6% in Ford's day to about 9% today. On the other hand, we spend only a quarter of what our great-grandparents paid for reading materials.           It is difficult to see how our spending patterns may change in the future. We already know that our population is aging and this will have an effect on the amount of money we spend on medical care. What is the subject discussed in the text?\nAnswer choices: A. Changing patterns in spending. | B. Changes in family planning. | C. Decrease in food demand. | D.

It is easy to get on with some one who is down to earth. A down-to-earth person is the opposite of someone who acts important or proud. Down-to-earth people could be important members of society. But they do not consider themselves to be better than others who are less important. A person who is filled with his own importance and pride is said to\" have his nose in the air\". Americans use another expression that is similar in some ways to down to earth. The expression is\" both feet on the ground\". Someone with both feet on the ground is a person with a good understanding of reality. He may have dreams, but he does not allow them to have influence on his understanding of what is real. The opposite kind of person is one who \"has his head in the clouds\". Someone with his head in the clouds is a person whose mind is not on what is happening in real life. Such a person may be called a day-dreamer. When we have both our feet on the ground, and when we are down to earth, we do not have our noses in the air. We act honestly and openly to others.

My kids watch closely as I swipe the card through the register. They've seen me do it hundreds, thousands of times. Cool. They are _ to swipe it through the machine themselves. When we walk out of the store with our groceries or pet food, or whatever, it's almost as though money has not changed hands, painless, easy. So it shouldn't be shocking to discover that teenagers are becoming card carrying consumers in their own right. The question is, should they? While some argue it's best to teach kids how to use a credit card while still living under the family roof, not everyone agrees. Dave Ramsey, financial expert says getting credit card for your teenager is actually \"an excellent way to teach him or her to be financially irresponsible.\" Now parents are required to co-sign on credit cards for children under 21. \"If their name is on the credit card, then the parent may say, Hey, my name is on this. Don't get me into trouble,\" says Mary Beth Pinto, a marketing professor. \"When parents were the co-obligors  , the children caused less debt. If the parents are the co-obligors, the tendency is that the parents were explaining how to use the cards.\" Still, Pinto believes parents should start the process much earlier. \"Yes, there has to be teaching going on and it has to start when they're younger. You're not going to get rid of credit cards. They are here to stay. You have to have them. You can't fight progress,\" Pinto said. Ramsey, however, disagrees. \"Throwing teens into a pool of (credit) sharks is a sure way to guarantee a life-time of heartache.\" he said, \"You can make online purchases and rent a car with a credit card. Of course, you must have money in your bank account before you can make a purchase with a credit card.

The study found that cigarette smoking among American teenagers dropped during t he past years. The drop continues a general decrease in teenager smoking rates that started in 1996.        American health officials praised the decrease as good news in the nation's battle against smoking. They note that smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death and disease. Smoking rates among American teenagers increased in the first half of the 1990's. However, teenage smoking rates have been decreasing in recent years.         The University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research supervised the latest study. The Department of Health and Human Services reported the findings.         The study involved more than forty-four-thousand students in more than four-hundred schools across the United States. They were asked about past and daily use of tobacco, alcohol and illegal drugs.         The youngest students questioned were thirteen years old. The study also involved fifteen-year-old students and seventeen-year-olds.         The most notable change in the study was a continuation of the decrease in cigarette use among thirteen and fifteen-year-olds. For example, about twelve percent of thirteen-year-old students questioned reported smoking at least one cigarette during the past month. Six years ago, the rate was twenty-one percent. Among fifteen-year-olds, the rate dropped from thirty percent in 1996 to twenty-one percent last year.         Tommy Thompson is the secretary of Health and Human Services. He praised the findings. He said more teenagers are making correct choices that will help them avoid health problems caused by tobacco.         The study found that use of alcoholic drinks and illegal drugs among American teenagers remained the same or dropped during the past year. However, the use of one illegal drug known as Ecstasy continued to increase. Yet the rate of increase was not as great as in recent years.         American health officials said they will continue to give teenagers scientific information about the serious health risks of Ecstasy and other illegal drugs. The goal is to further reduce the use of these drugs. In which section of the newspaper could we read the passage?\nAnswer choices: A. Entertainment. | B. Sports. | C. Education. | D.

You spend an hour with them and feel as if you have known them half your life. These people have something in common. And once we know what it is, we can try to do it ourselves. How is it done? Here are several skills that good talkers have. If you follow the skills, they'll help you put people at their ease, and make friends with them quickly. First of all, good talkers ask questions. Almost anyone, no matter how shy he is, will answer a question. One well-known businesswoman says, \"At business lunches, I always ask people what they did that morning. It's a common question, but it will get things going.\" From there you can move on to other matters--sometimes to really personal questions. And how he answers will let you know how far you can go. In addition, once good talkers have asked questions, they listen to the answers. This point seems clear, but it isn't. Your questions should have a point and help to tell what sort of person you are talking to. And to find out, you really have to listen carefully and attentively. Real listening at least means some things. First it means not to change the subject of conversation. If someone sticks to one topic, you can take it as a fact that he's really interested in it. Real listening also means not just listening to words, but to tones of voice. If the voice sounds dull, then, it's time for you to change the subject. Last but not least, good talkers know well how to deal with the occasion of parting. If you're saying good-bye, you may give him a firm handshake and say, \"I've really enjoyed meeting you.\" If you want to see that person again, don't keep it a secret.

The goals of becoming an outstanding player and playing college ball were never far from Deborah's mind. The game was against Mills High School. With 1 minute and 42 seconds left in the game, Deborah's team led by one point. A player of Mills had possession of the ball,and Deborah ran to guard against her. As Deborah was running to block the player, her knee went out and she fell down on the court in burning pain. Just like that, Deborah's season was over. After suffering the bad injury, Deborah found that, for the first time in her life, she was in a situation beyond her control. Game after game, she could do nothing but sit on the sidelines watching others play the game that she loved so much. Injuries limited Deborah's time on the court as she hurt her knees three more times in the next five years. She had to spend countless hours in a physical clinic to receive treatment. Her frequent visits there gave her a passion and respect for the profession.  And Deborah began to see a new light in her life.

The alarm clock announces the start of another busy weekday in the morning. You jump out of bed, rush into the shower, into your clothes and out the door with hardly a moment to think. A stressful journey to work gets your blood pressure climbing. Once at the office, you glance through the newspaper with depressing stories or reports of disasters. In that sort of mood, who can get down to work, particularly some creative, original problem-solving work? The way most of us spend our mornings is exactly opposite to the conditions that promote flexible, open-minded thinking. Imaginative ideas are most likely to come to us when we're unfocused. If you are one of those energetic morning people, your most inventive time comes in the early evening when you are relaxed. Sleepy people's lack of focus leads to an increase in creative problem solving. By not giving yourself time to tune into your wandering mind, you're missing out on the surprising solutions it may offer. The trip you take to work doesn't help, either. The stress slows down the speed with which signals travel between neurons  , making inspirations less likely to occur. And while we all should read a lot about what's going on in the world, it would not make you feel good for sure, so put that news website or newspaper aside until after the day's work is done. So what would our mornings look like if we wanted to start them with a full capacity for creative problem solving?

A few years ago, I was blessed with the opportunity to teach pre-school students one afternoon a week. One of my most memorable students was Vanessa. She was five years old, had difficulty walking, and could not speak. We mostly sat on the floor for our music lessons and Vanessa liked to sit on my lap. One of her favorite songs was John the Rabbit. It was a call and response song where I sang the call and the students clapped two times while singing the repeating phrase, \"Oh, yes!\" Vanessa liked to put her hands together with mine and clap with me. We performed that song during every class, Vanessa and I clapping together. She never said or sang a word. One day late in the school year, when the song was finished, Vanessa turned around, looked me in the eye, clapped her tiny hands two times and said the words \"Oh, yes!\" I opened my mouth and could not speak.

Even so, most white-collar work still happens in an office. One reason is that, according to findings of a new survey   of office workers conducted by Wakefield Research for the IT company Citrix, most bosses are doubtful about remote working. Half of the workers say their boss doesn't accept it, and only 35 percent say it's tolerated. Skeptical bosses will likely have their doubts reinforced   by the same survey, which shows that 43 percent of workers say they've watched TV or a movie while \"working\" remotely, while 35 percent have done housework,and 28 percent have cooked dinner. It is true, however, that working at home makes people much more efficient  , because it allows workers to take care of annoying housework while still getting their jobs done. It's much faster, for example, to shop for groceries at a quarter to three than to stand in line during the after-work rush. The fact that such practices remain officially unaccepted reflects how far we haven't come as a society from the days when we expected every full-time worker to be supported by a full-time homemaker. More broadly the Wakefield survey suggests that employers may be missing a low-cost way to give workers something of value. Sixty-four percent of those survey participants who haven't worked remotely would rather give up some bonus in order to get even one day a week working from home.

They look so much alike that they could be brother and sister. Do you believe that people who live together for many years would look alike? It's strange. but scientists say it's true. How scientists proved it? In a study, scientists found young couples only showed similarity by chance. However, elder couples were very likely to look like each other. The similarity could be very subtle  and could be found in wrinkles  or furrows, etc. Besides, some couples look far more alike than other couples. The scientists thought of several possible reasons: 1. Diet. \"We are what we eat.\" As couples usually share the same diet, will they probably look alike? For example, if both partners eat a high fat diet, their faces will tend to look fat. However, the scientists ruled this out  using another small study. 2. Environment. Will elderly couples show similarity because they live together in the same area for a long time? The environmental factors  such as sunshine and wind affect the skin in similar ways. The scientists ruled this possibility out as well. 3. Empathy . This is the theory  the scientists believe in. Couples grow to look similar because they are empathizing with each other. They copy each other's facial expressions. For example, if one partner often smiles in a certain way, the other is likely to copy it. In this way, their faces share similar wrinkles and furrows.

How can one measure it reliably? An analysis is issued on a sample of data from a Texas school district. Experts argue convincingly that teacher effectiveness should be measured by students' gains on standardized tests: Mr. Smith is probably a better teacher than Ms. Brown if his students consistently improve their test scores more than hers do. Though this approach is appealing, there are tricky issues. For example, what if Ms. Brown teaches in a school where students score so high there is little room for improvement? The authors try to correct for this problem, as well as other sorts of measurement issues, to generate a measurement of teacher effectiveness. The paper is primarily concerned with how this measure is related to other observable characteristics. The first finding is that there is a large variation in teacher effectiveness: some teachers consistently have a larger impact on their students' achievement than others. Second, easily observable characteristics like having a master's degree or a passing score on the teacher certification exam are not correlated with teacher effectiveness. Then what does matter? The most important single influence is experience: first-year teachers are much less effective than others. The second year is significantly better, and by the fourth year, _ . It is not entirely clear whether this experience effect is learning by doing (the more you teach, the more effective you become) or survival of the fittest (those who are not good at teaching tend to drop out early.) From my reading of the paper, both effects appear important and there is no simple answer. The data do suggest, however, that teacher effectiveness is pretty clear by the end of the second year, so the information to make an informed decision is available at that time. The authors also investigate the contentious issue of racial matching of students and teachers. Here they find strong evidence that minority teachers tend to be more effective with minority students. Again, it is unclear whether this is because of a role model effect (students respond better to a teacher of their own race) or an empathy effect (teachers empathize better with students of their own race) or something else entirely. The authors also look at teacher mobility. There is some evidence that teachers who quit teaching or switch schools tend to be below average in effectiveness. This is consistent with the survival-of-the-fittest model. Why do black teachers tend to be more effective with black students?\nAnswer choices: A. Students fell secure, so they respond better. | B. Teachers sympathize with students of their own race. | C. There are entirely some other identified reasons. | D.

Bill Wyman, former bass player  in the Rolling Stones, has pointed out that music video games discourage kids from learning to play real instruments. My own opinion suggest quite opposite. Last year, I bought Guitar Hero III for our 14-year-old son, Jack. Jack quickly mastered the process and entered an intense period of playing the game. A few months later, while I was away on tour, a couple of his friends came around with a real electric guitar. Playing Guitar Hero had taught them how to play along the track. Now they wanted to see if they could apply that to the real thing. Jack's friends taught him how to play along to his favorite songs using just his index finger  on the bass string. He got it right away. Guitar Hero had helped him over the first difficulty for guitar players--how to strum  the strings with one hand while making chord  shapes with the other. He never plays Guitar Hero now, preferring to rock out in the garage with his mates. Despite my attempts at getting him to learn an instrument, it was Guitar Hero that taught him the basics of playing and built up his confidence to the extent that he was able to make a recognizable sound the first time he played it.

Electric Current Adapter : If you bring any appliances, remember that the electricity in Eastern Europe uses 220 volts A.C., not the standard 110 volts of North America. A 110 volts appliance will soon burn out when attached to an unchanged 220-volt plug. Language Tools: One of Europe's biggest challenges is communicating with the local people since their languages are so different from our own. To help overcome difficulties, you might buy phrasebooks before you go -- you won't find them once you are in Eastern Europe. Money Belt: A money belt is especially helpful when you have many documents to carry around ( as you always do in Eastern Europe).

For me that includes celebrating Christmas on the 24th. Call, write Christmas cards, buy gifts and mail them to loved ones, just as if you were there. If you try to pretend   as if the holiday doesn't exist, you are just going to make it worse. Introduce your traditions to your loved ones, especially your kids. It will only enrich their celebration of the holiday to have some unique   traditions in their home. Little by little it will become their tradition and it's fun for them to try something new. Find clubs, churches or organizations that are from your home country. Chances are that they will have some celebration with some of your traditions which you can join in. Food is one of the most important factors in any kind of tradition. Find the recipe   of that cake your grandmother used and make it your tradition to bake that particular cake. Call up your parents and get them to send you some of your favorite childhood ornaments   for your tree. Pay attention to new traditions, talk to your family about which ones you want to make your own and stick with them.

It said they were unable to face the responsibility of having involved their country in an unnecessary war. Wildcat also has been used as a name for money in the 1800s. At that time, some states permitted banks to make their own money. One bank in the state of Michigan offered paper money with a picture of a wildcat on it. Some banks, however, did not have enough gold to support all the paper money they offered. So the money had little or no value. It was called a wildcat bill or a wildcat bank note.

Even greenhouse gas emissions   stopped tomorrow, the oceans will continue to become larger as they get warm. The climate scientists estimate that sea-level rise may be in the range of 1 to 2 meters by 2100, with a small risk of an even greater rise. For many islands and low-lying regions, even small rises will cause disasters. But for most countries, the problem is what has been built on that land: New York, Sydney and Tokyo, to mention just a few cities. Unless something can be done, great areas of urban network will disappear under the waves. It will take a great engineering effort to protect these cities---an effort that may be beyond economies that have been brought to their knees. None of this means we should fear, and stop trying to forbid emissions. But together with these efforts, we need to start acting now and we must stop building in danger zones. Billions of dollars are being spent on constructing homes, offices and roads in _ coastal areas. For instance, the skyscrapers of Shanghai are being built on land that is merely 4 meters above sea level on average, and they are sinking under the weight of the buildings. Therefore, planning for new coastal developments is to go against reality. If we want to build a lasting heritage for our children, we should do so on the plentiful land that is in no danger from the sea. It is one of the effective ways to slow down climate change, and we should be acting on it now. New York, Sydney, and Tokyo are mentioned in this passage to show   _  .\nAnswer choices: A. modern cities are usually built along the coastline | B. the coastline is very important for modern countries | C. climate changes have endangered many big cities on land | D. climate changes have been completely out of control\nWrap your final answer by filling in the placeholder below: 'So the answer is: \\{\\{placeholder\\}\\}'"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So the answer is: {C}"}]}

We humans have lived on earth for only 35 000 years, but during this period we have changed our planet a lot in many ways. Some things we've done are very good for the earth while some are bad. All over the world, people have cut down millions of trees. When it rains or when the wind blows, the earth is taken away. Forests have become deserts, so more and more sorts of animals and plants are disappearing. In big cities, cars and buses have polluted the air. Many people in cities now have health problems. Factories have also polluted the land and the water. As a result, many rivers and lakes are now dead. Around the earth, there's a special kind of oxygen called \"ozone\"(O3). It is important to the earth. But now air pollution is destroying it and that has made a very big hole in the ozone layer. Too much harmful radiation from the sun passes through the hole and reaches the earth directly. This is very dangerous because this kind of radiation can cause cancer. Carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air has increased a lot. It mainly comes from burning oil, coal and wood. This has formed a \"blanket\" around the earth. The heat from the sun can't escape so the temperature is rising. This is called \"the greenhouse effect\". It causes the level of the oceans to rise and the climate of the earth to change. All these problems are very serious, so we must do something now. ,A, B, C, D. Which is NOT true?\nAnswer choices: A. Cars can pollute the air. | B. Factories can pollute the water. | C.

Start a sensible eating and exercise plan right away. If you are motivated you can get reasonably fit in a few weeks. Tell your parents and friends you want to give it a try.

When we look at children's lives today in the USA, we can see the root(origin)of the problem--sports and foods. Young children like sports but they don't have enough around the start of high school. That's especially true for girls. Meanwhile, to make matters worse, schools are becoming much more interested in sports teams. So children are not able to get enough exercise just when they need it the most. There is also the food problem. Children get most of their calories  at restaurants or parties or somewhere else away from home. They often drink too many Cokes. Parents have a lot of fears about telling a child he needs to lose weight-- they are afraid it will push a child into an eating disorder. Some parents fear that pushing children to lose weight means their children will think they're not good enough, or not loved because of their weight. Parents need to come to terms with the fact that the family is very important to the children. The most useful program for children is called \"family weight control\". This is good news. Mom and Dad, even if they don't have weight problems, have to go through the same program as their children and learn how to get some exercise and how to eat healthily. Why are American children getting fatter?

I have a story of two good friends. They finished high school together. One wanted to further his studies while the other decided to look for a job. As time went on, the one that wanted to work was always there to support the other one especially in the area of fees in school for a long time. As destiny would have it, they both lost contact and after a very long time, they met again but on a very different level. The one that added values to himself by going back to school had stepped up greatly to become the general manager of a big company and the other was just a little lifted. So, it was time to pay back. The one of general manager could only support him financially and make him the chief driving officer in the company. Even though he would have loved to give him a higher post he was not qualified especially in terms of skills, orientation , experience and so on. In other words, his runway was too short for such an opportunity. Everyone must increase in knowledge and training . You must step up in your education level, human, business and communication skills. Your relationship with people must improve by being a good person.

It was through Charlie Chaplin that the Hollywood comedy movies became famous. Then in the 1920s came another trend of animated cartoons. They were the most popular Hollywood comedy movies of the time. The several popular characters of that era were Felix the cat, Krazy Kat and Betty Boop. However, the popularity of these movies was blocked out due to lack of sound and color. The end of 1920s, the Hollywood comedy industry marked a change brought about by the introduction of sound into the movies. This has allowed the industry to create dramatic new film styles and use verbal humor. These films were soon replacing silent movies. These films used dialogue of comedians such as the W.C Fields and the Marx Brothers. Charlie Chaplin was the last comedian to have acted in the silent films. When the United States entered into World War II, Hollywood movies changed its course to themes related to the conflicts, and Hollywood comedy movies described more on military themes. The war time experienced a boom, where restrictions on the traveling made nearly a quarter of the money spent on attending movies. In the 1950s, the interest shifted where the TV became popular. During this time the release of Hollywood comedy films declined  . The 1960s saw an increasing number of broad, star-packed comedies. In 1970 Hollywood comedy movies reflected the anti-war sentiment, which was popular then.

Poland has its folks. Hungary has its czardas. Argentina is famous for the tango. The U.S.A.is known for jazz,the type of music that has gained worldwide popularity. Jazz is an American contribution to popular music. While classical music follows formal European tradition,jazz is rather a free form. It is full of energy,expressing the moods,interests,and emotions of the people. It is breaking and exciting with a modern sound. In the 1920s jazz sounded like America. And so it does today. The origins of the music are as interesting as the music itself. Jazz was invented by American Negroes,or blacks,as they are called today,who were brought to the southern states as slaves. They were sold to farm owners and forced to work long hours in the cotton and tobacco fields. This work was hard and life was short. When a Negro died his friends and  s would gather and carry the body to have a ceremony before they buried him. There was always a band with them. On the way to the ceremony the band played slowly,solemn music suitable for the situation. But on the way home the mood changed. Spirits lifted. Everyone was happy. Death had removed one of their members,but the living were glad to be alive. The band played happy music. This music made everyone want to dance. It was an early form of jazz. Music has always been important in Negro life. The black,who were brought to American from West Africa,had a rich musical tradition. In the fields,they made up work songs. Singing made the hard work go faster. And when they got to Christianity,they made lovely spirituals,which have become an everlasting part of American music.

It is so unique that in 2004 it became a World Heritage Site. I recently returned to my home city and my first stop was at a museum on the River Mersey. Blanketed in mist , Victorian architecture rose from the banks of the river, responded to the sounds of sea-birds, and appeared unbelievably charming. When I headed toward the centre, I found myself surrounded by buildings that mirror the best palaces of Europe. It is not hard to imagine why, on first seeing the city, most visitors would be overpowered by the beauty of the noble buildings, which are solid signs of Liverpool's history. As if to stress its cultural role, Liverpool has more museums and galleries  than most cities in Britain. At Walker Art Gallery, I was told that it has the best collections of Victorian paintings in the world, and is the home of modern art in the north of England. However, culture is more than galleries. Liverpool offers many music events. As Britain's No.1 music city, it has the biggest city music festival in Europe, and its musicians are famous all over the world. Liverpool is also well-known for its football and other sports events. Every year, the Mersey River Festival attracts thousands of visitors, making the city a place of wonder. As you would expect from such a city, there are restaurants serving food from around the world. When my trip was about to complete, I chose to rest my legs in Liverpool's famous Philharmonic pub . It is a monument to perfection, and a heritage attraction itself. Being a World Heritage Site, my home city is certainly a place of \"outstanding universal value\". It is a treasure house with plenty of secrets for the world to explore.

It is the biggest lake in Britain. It is over thirty kilometres long and in places nearly 300 meters deep. It is cold and dark and not many people went there until after 1930. Then a road was made around the lake. Holiday makers began to use the road, and this was when the stories began. Someone said that he had seen a monster in the lake. He said it was twelve meters long. It had a long neck and a small head. Then someone else said he had seen it. Others said the same thing and in 1933 a London doctor took a photo. It looked like a monster with a long neck and a thick body but the photo was not dear. The newspapers printed the picture and called it the Loch Ness monster, or \"Nessie\". Then the argument began. Some people, however, were certain there was something living in the lake. Others said there was nothing there. In 1961, a lot of people joined together to make a real effort to see and photograph the monster if there was one! Several times people thought they saw something but after ten years there was still no real proof. Later underwater television cameras were used, but no one found any real proof. However, they did find something interesting: a huge underwater cave. It was big enough to be home of a monster, but of course, this was not a proof. In 1975, however, some American scientists formed a search group. They used an underwater camera. It took pictures every seventy seconds. Some of the pictures seemed to show a red-brown creature. Its body was about four meters long and had a very ugly head on the end of a four meter neck. Many people then began to believe in the monster. But even today we can not be certain.

Golden Monkeys       Golden monkeys are mainly found in Sichuan, Gansu, Shanxi provinces and Shengnongjia mountainous area of Hubei Province. Golden monkeys have golden-orange fur. They move around in the daytime, usually in groups of as many as 100 to 200 heads, or 20 to 30 heads. They feed on fruits and young leaves of bamboos. But people are destroying the environment where they live. Trees and bamboos are disappearing, so golden monkeys have less and less to eat. Elephans ks5u Elephants are very big and strong. They are bigger than any other animals on land. They are grey and have long trunks and tusks. They have poor eyesight, but very good hearing and smell. They can lift heavy things and break down branches with their trunks. Elephants are very friendly towards each other and towards their neighbours. Normally, they live in a group for many years. Young male elephants do not leave the group until they are about 12 years old. Now, there are very few elephants in the world.

Make the reader want to continue reading by writing about ordinary things in a new and surprising way. Get your facts right It's no good giving a description of a town or explaining how a jet engine works if you get it wrong. So avoid writing anything unless you're certain about it. Hold the reader's attention Make the beginning interesting and the ending a surprise. There is nothing worse than a poor ending. Develop the story carefully and try to think of something unusual happening at the end. Think about the characters Try to bring the people in your story alive for the reader by using well-chosen words to make them seem real.

Having the ability to laugh can help one overcome anxiety, and make better decisions in difficult situations. People with a well-developed sense of humour appear to be happier, and some are healthier as well. This suggests that having a sense of humour is good for you. Humourless people may find themselves being treated as a fool, and become anxious and upset. A sense of humour also plays an important role in human relationships. However, not everyone has a sense of humour. People with developmental disabilities   can sometimes have no sense of humour, or have a very strange one. A number of factors affect a person's sense of humour, with the age probably being the main one. Young children are often highly amused by simple jokes or shows, while teenagers prefer to enjoy the ironic   events. Educational level, culture, and religious faith also affect one's sense of humour. While Christians, for example, may have a deep appreciation of jokes about the Bible, others may find them disrespectful. Many people believe that a sense of humour is something that develops on its own, and that you cannot teach someone to understand why jokes, certain comments, situations or events are funny. However, things can be done to one's sense of humour. Children, for example, benefit from being told jokes and encouraged to laugh, although some children's jokes might seem rather strange to adults. If you have children, try to encourage them to tell jokes and think about what makes things funny. And it will help them develop a sense of humour.

She has been praised by both mainland and international media for her sense of fashion on earlier state visits. Following her arrival in the U.S., she is set for a much-anticipated fashion face-off with her fellow, U.S. first lady Michelle Obama later this week. Here we take a look at four key differences between the two fashion icons. 1 Backgrounds Peng Liyuan Peng, a Yuncheng county, Shandong native, joined the People's Liberation Army when she was 18. She was one of the first people on the mainland to obtain a master's degree in ethnic music at the China Conservatory of Music. Her vocal talents made her a superstar as an army soprano , and she has given many singing performances at home and abroad. Michelle Obama Michelle grew up with her older brother, Craig, in Chicago. Her father was a water plant operator, and her mother was a full-time housewife until her daughter went to high school. She went to state school, and later graduated from Princeton University with a bachelor's degree in sociology. She then attended Harvard Law School in 1988, where she earned a doctorate in law. 2 Professions Peng Liyuan Aside from being the first lady of China and a singer, Peng is also the president of the People's Liberation Army's Academy of Art College. She has since stepped down from public performances, but continues with her charity work. Michelle Obama After working as a lawyer, Michelle began to work in public service and was the associate dean at the University of Chicago.

The concept dates back to 1623, when the first patent law to protect IP rights was passed. IP rights protect an artist from having his/her creative ideas copied by another. For example, if somebody generated an idea for a novel, that idea is protected by IP rights. If someone else wishes to represent the idea or develop it further, he/she must consult the original artists, who will normally be rewarded financially for its use. Back in the 17thcentury, IP rights were primarily carried out to protect newly developed manufacturing processes against stealing, but today intellectual property rights are also enjoyed by those who create music, art and literature. In recent years, IP rights have been the focus of a great deal of discussion because of a technology which looks set to weaken them altogether: the Internet. Many years ago, if you wanted a recoding of a song, you would have to purchase it from a music store; if a novel, from a book store. In those days, IP rights were easily protected since it was very difficult to obtain intellectual property without paying for it. However, a lot of IP, including songs, films, books and artwork, can be downloaded today free of charge using the internet. This practice has now taken the world by storm, dramatically affecting the way in which we view IP rights.

However, bad friends are easier to find than good friends these days. If you're sitting there and wondering if you have a bad friend, let me define it for you. A bad friend is someone whose jealousies and insecurities outweigh their love for someone. They night want to be a good friend but they're too messed up in their own head to ever actually do it. They wonder if their friends are going out without them or if they're being forgotten and left behind. People who are violently insecure don't have what it takes to be the quality of a friend. Bad friends are narcissistic .They look for any opportunity to bring the conversation back to them. Worse, they might not even be aware that they're doing it. In their mind, they might think they are the best friend ever, which is truly frightening. Bad friends are quick-change. They're by your side when you're fun and you have something to give them but as soon as you're going through a difficult time, they will become indifferent quickly. They won't bring you cold medicine. They won't give you a ride to the doctor, everything they do is self-serving. If you find a friend who has these same characteristics, send them to your bad friend list immediately. Your friends are supposed to be the solution to your problems, not the source. I believe your twenties are a time when you need positive and helpful friends. In such a time, friendships aren't easy to maintain like they once were in school. Now we actually have to put work into it, we have to make a conscious effort to keep the friendship going. You need to ask yourself, \"Is this person worth it? Do they treat me like a fool or what?\" if your have doubts, try to make them clear by considering the past experiences. Toxic  friendships do nothing but drag you down. My point is that you have to take care of yourself and stop getting in touch with your bad friends. Only surround yourself with people who bring out the best qualities in you. It may sound cruel but it's true,.

During their lifetime, it can be expected that of these 3,000 about 23 will be murdered, 30 will die in traffic accidents, and nearly 750 will be killed by a smoking-related disease. The number of deaths due to cigarette smoking outweighs all other factors, whether voluntary or involuntary, as a cause of death.

Second, in the late 1970s, smoking among male high school seniors beat that among female by nearly 10 percent . The statistic is reversing  .

P.S.116 Principal Jane Hsu wrote a letter to parents last month explaining that after more than a year of analyzing studies,the school had concluded that students'after-school time would be better spent on activities like reading at their own pace and playing rather than working on homework. Hsu's letter says that many studies indicate that there is no connection between homework and academic success.Indeed,there are some studies that show that the link between homework and success is doubtful at the primary school level. An important 1989 study on homework by Professor Cooper found that doing homework led students to perform better in school as they grew older.In later grades,students who did homework performed increasingly better than students who did not.In 2006,Cooper published a study that analyzed 15 years'worth of data on the effectiveness of homework.He found that homework had a more positive impact on students as they aged,and identified stronger relations between homework and achievement for students in grades seven through 12 than for students in kindergarten through sixth grade. A 2012 study from the Indiana University School of Education on 10th-graders found little relation between time spent on homework and better course grades,although it did find a positive relation between homework time and standardized test performance.

Early in the Five dynasties, a man named Li Ye used to make and fly a kite in the emperor's court. He once attached a whistle made of bamboo to the kite. Sound was let out when the kite was flying. The kite was named after  Zheng, a kind of Chinese music instrument. Then it was named Fengzheng in Chinese. The earliest kite in the world was made by Motse, a famous Chinese philosopher, who lived 2,300 years ago, for military   purposes. He spent three years making an eagle and managed to fly it. The eagle was later regarded as the first kite in the world. Kite-flying became a recreation probably from the Tang dynasty when the royal family and people of the highest class were addicted to it. It was said that the Emperor Xuanzong in the Tang Dynasty once was interested in a kite named Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea flying in the air. Later, the paper-made kite was invented, which cost less and spread quickly among the common people. As time went on, kites flew to various countries in the world. 'The well-known British scientist, Dr. Needham, once described kites as an important scientific invention which spread to Europe from China in his book, A History of China's Science and Technology. The invention of the kite inspired men's dream of flying and led to the invention of the airplane. Why was kite-flying not a popular recreation among common people at first?\nAnswer choices: A. Because they were too busy to fly kites. | B. Because they were not allowed to fly kites. | C. Because it was difficult to make kites. | D.

Zhang Ping, who heads China's National Development and Reform Commission, the central economic planning agency, said only five or six of China's 30 provinces are targeting annual economic growth of 8 percent or 9 percent. The remaining provinces are aiming for growth rates of more than 10 percent this year, with some wanting to double economic output in the coming five years. \"China has a planned energy supply of about 4 billion cubic tons of coal equivalent for the next five years, and this is not enough to meet demands for economic growth to double,\" he was quoted as saying on the news portal Sina.Com. Beijing is increasingly concerned with the ambitions of Chinese provinces across the country to chase high growth despite the central government's urgent request for a more moderate and sustainable pace of expansion. Years of rapid economic growth has China's environment, with Beijing trying to remove some of the damage now.It has an annual growth target of 7 percent for the next five years, well down from last year's 10 percent. Zhang said Beijing has asked local governments to take into account the supply of \"energy, environment, water and land\" to set more reasonable growth targets.

Although there have always been deaf individuals in America, the history really begins in 1817. Before 1817 deaf people communicated by using \"home signs\". Gestures were individually created and used within the home for simple communication. There were no schools or formal sign language training for the deaf. So, why was 1817 an important date? Well, the story begins with Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet. Gallaudet met his neighbor's daughter Alice Cogswell. Alice was the young deaf daughter of Dr. Mason Cogswell from Hartford, Connecticut. Gallaudet began teaching Alice to read and write a few simple words. Excited by the success Dr. Cogswell encouraged Gallaudet to establish a school for the deaf. Cogswell raised the money and Gallaudet traveled to Britain to learn the methods used there. However, the schools refused to share their instructional techniques and methods. While in London, there happened to be a demonstration of the French method of deaf education. Britain was using an oral method of instruction; however, the French method used signs. Gallaudet was fascinated with the method and was able to meet with the instructor, Sicard, and his two deaf pupils, Jean Massieu and Laurent Clerc. Sicard agreed to teach Gallaudet his method and Gallaudet went to Paris to learn French signs. After a while, Gallaudet wished to return home and convinced Clerc to go with him and help him establish the school. The trip home was a 52-day voyage during which Clerc taught Gallaudet French signs and Gallaudet taught Clerc English. On April 15, 1817, Laurent Clerc and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet established what is currently known as the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut. The opening of the first school for the deaf can be viewed as one of the most important events in current deaf culture. Schools in Britain didn't teach Gallaudet because   _  .\nAnswer choices: A. their methods were quite different | B. they thought it was impossible for Gallaudet to learn | C. Gallaudet knew little about sign language | D. they wanted to keep their methods a secret\nWrap your final answer using triple quotation marks."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "'''D'''"}]}

But be careful--the warm weather is also a hotbed for viruses  and disease. This March, the influenza  A(H7N9) virus hit Shanghai, Anhui, Jiangsu and Zhejiang. It was reported that by April 11 at least 35 people had been infected   with the H7N9 virus, and nine of them had died. The influenza A (H7N9) virus is one type of influenza A H7 viruses. Influenza A H7 viruses normally spread among birds. This is the first time human infections with H7N9 viruses have been reported in China. Earlier reports were about H5N1 and H1N1. All the three viruses are influenza A viruses but they are not the same. H7N9 and H5N1 are animal influenza viruses that could infect people. However, H1N1 viruses can be divided into two groups. One group can normally infect people and the other normally infects animals. Also, H1N1 can spread from human to human, but H7N9 probably can't, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Most people infected with H7N9 looked like they had the common flu. Some people had bad pneumonia . They suffered from a fever, a cough and shortness of breath. But don't be afraid - it is not easy to be infected with the virus. One of the possible reasons is close contact with sick poultry   waste. People may also be infected through breath, according to National Health and Family Planning Commission. Here are some tips from the WHO that can protect you from being infected. Wash your hands with soap and running water before you eat, after you use the toilet, and after touching animals or animal waste. When coughing or sneezing cover your mouth and nose with a mask ,tissue  or a sleeve. Get a good rest and do exercises, which will help make your body strong enough to stand up to the virus. What's the name of the influenza virus that hit Shanghai, Anhui, Jiangsu and Zhejiang this March?\nAnswer choices: A. It is the H7N9 virus. | B. It is the H5N1 virus. | C. It is the H1N1 virus. | D. It is A H7 virus.\nWrap your final answer using triple quotation marks."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "'''A'''"}]}

When we look at children's lives today in the USA, we can see the root(origin)of the problem--sports and foods. Young children like sports but they don't have enough around the start of high school. That's especially true for girls. Meanwhile, to make matters worse, schools are becoming much more interested in sports teams. So children are not able to get enough exercise just when they need it the most. There is also the food problem. Children get most of their calories  at restaurants or parties or somewhere else away from home. They often drink too many Cokes. Parents have a lot of fears about telling a child he needs to lose weight-- they are afraid it will push a child into an eating disorder. Some parents fear that pushing children to lose weight means their children will think they're not good enough, or not loved because of their weight. Parents need to come to terms with the fact that the family is very important to the children. The most useful program for children is called \"family weight control\". This is good news. Mom and Dad, even if they don't have weight problems, have to go through the same program as their children and learn how to get some exercise and how to eat healthily.

It is a famous English-language bookstore on the left bank of the river Seine. The first Shakespeare and Company in history was opened in 1919 by an American, Sylvia Beach. Ms. Beach did more than sell books. Her bookstore was also a library, and she even prepared beds for writers visiting there. Ms. Beach was not only kind to people but also good at choosing books, so her bookstore was often visited by writers like Ernest Hemingway and James Joyce. But in 1941, after the Germans took power in Paris, Ms. Beach was told to close her bookstore. In 1951, another American, George Whitman, opened in Paris another English-language bookstore, Librairie Mistral. Since then, just as Ms. Beach did, Mr. Whitman has also made his bookstore a library for people to borrow books, and a free hotel for writers to stay in. To remember Ms. Beach, Mr. Whitman changed the name of his bookstore to Shakespeare and Company in 1964, two years after Ms. Beach died.

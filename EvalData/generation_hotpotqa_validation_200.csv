Context: ""Sword Art Online"" is a science fantasy anime series adapted from the light novel series of the same title written by Reki Kawahara and illustrated by Abec. It was produced by A-1 Pictures and the SAO Project, and directed by Tomohiko Itō. It is divided into the ""Aincrad"" and ""Fairy Dance"" arcs. The story of the first season follows the adventures of Kazuto ""Kirito"" Kirigaya and Asuna Yuuki, two players who are trapped in the virtual world of ""Sword Art Online"" (SAO). They are tasked to clear all 100 Floors and defeat the final boss in order to be freed from the game. Three months after the death game, Kazuto discovers that Asuna is being held captive in ""ALfheim Online"" (ALO), a spiritual successor to SAO, where the players assume the roles of fairies. Kazuto enters the game and allies himself with his sister Suguha ""Leafa"" Kirigaya to rescue Asuna from captivity. <SEP> Angampora (Sinhalese: අංගම්පොර , is a form of martial art from Sri Lanka that combines combat techniques, self-defense, sport, exercise, and meditation. A key component of angampora is the namesake ""angam"", which incorporates hand-to-hand fighting, and ""illangam"", involving the use of indigenous weapons such as the ethunu kaduwa, staves, knives and swords. Another component known as ""maya angam"", which uses spells and incantations for combat, is also said to have existed. Angampora's distinct feature lies in the use of pressure point attacks to inflict pain or permanently paralyze the opponent. Fighters usually make use of both striking and grappling techniques, and fight until the opponent is caught in a submission lock that they cannot escape. Usage of weapons is discretionary. Perimeters of fighting are defined in advance, and in some of the cases is a pit. With the advent of colonialism over the entirety of the island in 1815, Angampora fell into disuse and was very nearly lost as a part of the country's heritage. The British administration prohibited its practice due to the dangers posed by a civilian populace versed in a martial art, burning down any ""angan madu"" (practice huts devoted to the martial art) found: flouting of the law was punished by a gunshot to the knee, effectively crippling practitioners; Angampora nevertheless survived within a few families, allowing it to emerge into mainstream Sri Lankan culture post-independence. <SEP> In Wing Chun martial arts, Pak Sao is a blocking technique similar to a parry used in boxing. With ""Pak Sao"", the hand comes directly out of the center of the body to slap away an attacker's strike to one's head. Effective application of ""Pak Sao"" involves creating an angle of deflection through which the opponent's blow can be slapped away with minimal effort. <SEP> Hélio Gracie (] ; October 1, 1913 – January 29, 2009) was a Brazilian martial artist who, together with his brother Carlos Gracie, founded the martial art of Gracie jiu-jitsu and with Luiz França and Oswaldo Fadda the martial art of Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ). According to Rorion Gracie, his father Hélio is one of the first sports heroes in Brazilian history; he was named Man of the Year in 1997 by the American martial arts publication ""Black Belt"" magazine. A patriarch of the Gracie family, he was the father of Rickson, Royler, Royce, Relson, and Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) co-founder Rorion Gracie, among other sons and daughters. <SEP> Soo Bahk Do is a martial art founded and taught by Kwan Jang Nim Hwang Kee, his successor Hwang Hyun Chul, known as H.C. Hwang, and instructors who are certified by member organizations of the World Moo Duk Kwan, Inc. This martial art was originally the ancient martial art of Korea. Hwang Kee created Moo Duk Kwan with influence from ""Soo Bahk Do"" <SEP> Hwa Rang Do, also known as ""The Way of the Flowering Knights"" (Hangul: 화랑도 ; Hanja: 花郞道 ) is a comprehensive Korean martial art that was developed in the 1960s by Joo Bang Lee and his brother Joo Sang Lee. Hwa Rang Do as a martial art has multiple areas of focus including stand up fighting with open-hand striking, weapons, throws and takedowns, ground fighting, various types of meditative practices, intellectual and character development, and artistic and cultural pursuits. <SEP> Cho Hee Il (born October 13, 1940) is a prominent Korean-American master of taekwondo, holding the rank of 9th ""dan"" in the martial art. He has written 11 martial art books, produced 70 martial art training videos, and has appeared on more than 70 martial arts magazine covers. Cho won several national and international competitions as a taekwondo competitor, and has appeared in several films, including ""Fight to Win"", ""Best of the Best"", ""Bloodsport II"", and ""Bloodsport III"". He founded the Action International Martial Arts Association (AIMAA) in 1980, and is its President. Cho is a member of both ""Black Belt"" magazine's Hall of Fame and ""Tae Kwon Do Times"" magazine's Hall of Fame. <SEP> Taijutsu (体術 , literally ""body technique"" or ""body skill"") is a Japanese blanket term for any combat skill, technique or system of martial art using body movements that are described as an empty-hand combat skill or system. The term is commonly used when referring to a traditional Japanese martial art but has also been used in the naming of modern martial arts such as Bujinkan Budo Taijutsu. Taijutsu is similar to Karate but is more focused on the body techniques. More specific names than taijutsu are typically used when describing a martial art, such as jujutsu (focusing on throwing, grappling, and submission), judo (focusing on throwing and grappling), aikido (focusing on throwing and joint locks) as well as karate and kenpō (focusing on striking). <SEP> Lerdrit (Thai: เลิศฤทธิ์, rtgs: loetrit, IPA: [lɤ̂ːt.rít]) is a Thai martial art taught and used by the Royal Thai Army. Muay Lert Rit (or Lerdrit) is a style of fighting derived from Thai Martial Arts (Muay Boran). A selection was made among the very large portfolio of techniques already available in the different styles and adapted to close combat. Many of the technique can be used very close or taken directly from the Mae Mai (Standard techniques for bare hand fighting) or the Look Mai (Advanced fighting techniques). As with all military techniques, the goal is radical. <SEP> Wing Chun () is a traditional Southern Chinese martial art specializing in close range combat. It is known for being economical, direct and efficient. ."

They were listed in the 1975 ""Guinness Book of World Records"" as ""the globe's loudest band"" for a 1972 concert at London's Rainbow Theatre, and have sold over 100 million albums worldwide. <SEP> WhoCares was a supergroup formed by Ian Gillan of Deep Purple and Tony Iommi of Black Sabbath in 2011 with the participation of a great number of rock artists as a charity project to raise money to rebuild a music school in Gyumri, Armenia after the destruction of the city in the 1988 earthquake in Armenia. The album sold more than 20,000 copies in Europe. <SEP> Deep Purple are an English hard rock band from Hertford, Hertfordshire. Originally known as Roundabout, the group formed in March 1968 featuring vocalist Rod Evans, guitarist Ritchie Blackmore, bassist Nick Simper, drummer Ian Paice and keyboardist Jon Lord. This first lineup of the band, known as Mark I, released three albums within the space of a year – ""Shades of Deep Purple"", ""The Book of Taliesyn"" and ""Deep Purple"" – before Evans and Simper were fired from the band at the request of Blackmore and Lord. Mark II of Deep Purple saw Ian Gillan and Roger Glover replace Evans and Simper, respectively, in the summer of 1969. This lineup of the band has since been identified as their most successful, with their next four albums reaching the top four of the UK Albums Chart, including number-one albums ""Fireball"" and ""Machine Head"". <SEP> Safari Records was an UK independent record label based in London and operating between 1977 and 1985. Safari Records was formed early in 1977 by Tony Edwards (former co-manager of Deep Purple), Andreas Budde (the son of German music publisher Rolf Budde) and John Craig who previously ran Purple and Oyster Records. With the label's founders living in Paris, Berlin and London respectively, the plan was to develop a pan-European record company that would release pop records. Licensing deals were struck with Teldec in Germany and Disques Vogue in France, in the UK its product was pressed and distributed by Pye and later by Spartan Records. Most notable of the label's acts were Wayne County, The Boys, Toyah and the South Africa's first multiracial band Juluka."

Context: Triste Fim de Policarpo Quaresma (in English: The Tragic Fate of Policarpo Quaresma) is a novel by Pre-Modernist Brazilian writer Lima Barreto. The work was published under ""feuilleton"" form in 1911, from August to October in the ""Jornal do Commercio"". The focus of the work is the nationalism in the early years of the First Brazilian Republic and criticism to the middle-class and the bureaucratic government. The work is comical in the beginning, transiting to harsh criticisms by the end. These critics demystify the figure of the president Floriano Peixoto (1891–1894), known as the ""Marechal de Ferro"" (""The Iron Marshal""), and also of the Brazilian military. <SEP> Hurricane Amanda was the strongest Eastern Pacific tropical cyclone ever recorded in the month of May. The first named storm, hurricane and major hurricane of the 2014 Pacific hurricane season, Amanda originated from a tropical wave that had entered the Eastern Pacific on May 16. Slow development occurred as it tracked westward, and development into a tropical depression occurred on May 22. The depression later strengthened into a tropical storm on May 23. Amid very favorable conditions, Amanda then rapidly intensified late on May 23, eventually reaching its peak intensity on May 25 as a high-end Category 4 hurricane. Afterwards, steady weakening occurred due to upwelling beneath the storm, and Amanda fell below major hurricane intensity on May 26. Rapid weakening occurred and the cyclone eventually dissipated on May 29. <SEP> The 6th Adelaide Film Festival took place in Adelaide, Australia, from 10 to 20 October 2013. This was Amanda Duthie's first year as Festival Director (after eight years at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and eight years at the Special Broadcasting Service during the 1990s), having taken over from Katrina Sedgwick. Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton served as the festival’s patrons. <SEP> The 7th Adelaide Film Festival was held in Adelaide, Australia, from 15–25 October 2015. Amanda Duthie was again the Festival Director. On the opening night of the festival, Director and screenwriter Andrew Bovell received the 2015 Don Dunstan Award for his contribution to the Australian film industry. <SEP> The 2001 Pacific hurricane season was a near average season. The most notable storm that year was Hurricane Juliette, which caused devastating floods in Baja California, leading to 12 fatalities and $400 million (2001 USD; $  USD) worth of damage. Two other storms were notable in their own rights, Hurricane Adolph became the strongest May Hurricane until 2014 when both records set by Adolph and Juliette were broken by Hurricanes Amanda and Odile. Tropical Storm Barbara passed just north of Hawaii, bringing minimal impact. <SEP> The President's Management Advisory Board is a council of 17 corporate executives from leading American companies. Its purpose is to provide the administration of the executive branch advice and recommendations on effective strategies for the implementation of the best business practices on matters related to federal government's management and operations, with focus on productivity, the implementation of innovative methods, customer service, and technology. The board will be chaired by former Sirius/XM Satellite Radio Director Jeffrey Zients as part of the General Services Administration of the Executive Office. On March 10, 2011, board appointees were announced, including Greg Brown, president and chief executive officer of Motorola Solutions, Inc.; Sam Gilliland, Chairman and CEO of Sabre Holdings; Debra L. Lee, Chairman and CEO of BET Networks; Shantanu Narayen, president and CEO of Adobe Systems, Inc.; and Tim Solso, Chairman and CEO of Cummins, Inc. <SEP> Sarah Elizabeth Henrickson is a character on the HBO series ""Big Love"". She is portrayed by Amanda Seyfried. Sarah is the eldest child of Bill Henrickson with his first and legal wife Barbara Henrickson. Though only a supporting character in the first two seasons, Sarah became popular in the show in its third season until actress Amanda Seyfried decided to depart the show to focus on her movie career at the end of season four. She returned in the series finale in the last scene. <SEP> The season produced twenty-three tropical depressions. All but one further intensified into tropical storms and sixteen further intensified to become hurricanes, which broke the record holding the most number of hurricanes within the basin tied with the 1990 and 1992 seasons. The first named storm of the season, Amanda, developed on May 22 before intensifying into a hurricane on May 24. At 0300 UTC on May 25, it intensified into Category 3 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, becoming the second-earliest major hurricane on record, behind 2012's Hurricane Bud. At 1500 UTC, Amanda reached its peak intensity with winds of 155 mph (250 km/h), becoming the strongest May hurricane on record in the eastern Pacific. In mid-June, Hurricane Cristina intensified to become the earliest second major hurricane on the record in the East Pacific, beating the previous record set by Hurricane Darby in 2010. On August 24, Hurricane Marie became the first Category 5 Pacific hurricane since Hurricane Celia in 2010, and it was the sixth most intense Pacific hurricane on record in terms of minimum atmospheric pressure. <SEP> Amanda Duthie, Scottish-born Australian, is one of the leading figures in Australia's arts and culture industries and is currently the CEO/Creative Director of the Adelaide Film Festival and CEO of Hybrid World Adelaide. <SEP> Amanda Matthews (born 1968) is an American sculptor and painter from Louisville, Kentucky, United States, who lives in Lexington, Kentucky.

He also appears in the television series, ""The Muppets."" <SEP> Motion pictures featuring Santa Claus abound and apparently constitute their own subgenre of the Christmas film genre. Early films of Santa revolve around similar simple plots of Santa's Christmas Eve visit to children. In 1897, in a short film called ""Santa Claus Filling Stockings"", Santa Claus is simply filling stockings from his pack of toys. Another film called ""Santa Claus and the Children"" was made in 1898. A year later, a film directed by George Albert Smith in titled ""Santa Claus"" (or ""The Visit from Santa Claus"" in the United Kingdom) was created. In this picture, Santa Claus enters the room from the fireplace and proceeds to trim the tree. He then fills the stockings that were previously hung on the mantle by the children. After walking backward and surveying his work, he suddenly darts at the fireplace and disappears up the chimney. ""Santa Claus' Visit"" in 1900 featured a scene with two little children kneeling at the feet of their mother and saying their prayers. The mother tucks the children snugly in bed and leaves the room. Santa Claus suddenly appears on the roof, just outside the children's bedroom window, and proceeds to enter the chimney, taking with him his bag of presents and a little hand sled for one of the children. He goes down the chimney and suddenly appears in the children's room through the fireplace. He distributes the presents and mysteriously causes the appearance of a Christmas tree laden with gifts.

The bridge is owned and maintained by the City of Treasure Island, which used to charge all motorists $1.00 toll, until June, 2006, when the first span of the bridge was reopened with no toll booth. Residents of two St. Petersburg waterfront communities (Causeway Isles and Yacht Club Estates) used to pay a $10 annual road tax to the City of Treasure Island to help support road and median maintenance.

Context: Cassytha is a genus of some two dozen species of obligately parasitic vines in the family Lauraceae. Superficially, and in some aspects of their ecology, they closely resemble plants in the unrelated genus ""Cuscuta"", the dodders. When fruit and flowers are absent in the field, the physical resemblance is so close that few people without technical training can tell them apart. In this respect and in their ecology the two genera present a spectacular example of convergent evolution. In its divergence from habits typical of the Lauraceae, ""Cassytha"" also presents examples of mosaic evolution <SEP> Deckenia is a genus of freshwater crabs from East Africa, in the family Potamonautidae, or sometimes in a family of its own, Deckeniidae. The genus was named by Hilgendorf after Karl Klaus von der Decken who collected the first examples during his expeditions to Africa. Both species live in swamps from Eyl in Somalia to Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, both in coastal areas and further inland. A third species, ""Deckenia alluaudi"", lives in the Seychelles, and has been transferred to a separate genus, ""Seychellum"". <SEP> Miltoniopsis, abbreviated Mltnps in horticultural trade, is a genus of orchids native to Costa Rica, Panama, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. This genus comprises 5 species. Miltoniopsis's common name is Pansy Orchid. <SEP> Miltoniopsis vexillaria (""the flag-like ""Miltoniopsis"""") is a species of epiphytic orchid in the genus Miltoniopsis. <SEP> Strobilanthes is a genus of about 350 species of flowering plants in the family Acanthaceae, mostly native to tropical Asia and Madagascar, but with a few species extending north into temperate regions of Asia. Many species are cultivated for their 2-lipped, hooded flowers in shades of blue, pink, white and purple. Most are frost-tender and require protection in frost-prone areas. <SEP> Strobilanthes japonica is a flowering herbaceous perennial plant from Asia, one of around 350 plants of the genus ""Strobilanthes"". The 20–50 cm ornamental plant is cultivated in Japan and China, and blooms in autumn with 1.5 cm purple to white funnel-shaped flowers. <SEP> Nematops is a genus of righteye flounders native to the Indo-West Pacific. Due to their small size (up to 10 cm ) and depth of habitation (up to 650 m ) few examples of this genus are caught, and as a result little is known of their morphology and distribution. <SEP> Kallima paralekta, the Indian leafwing or Malayan leafwing, is a species of brush-footed butterfly of the genus ""Kallima"". Despite its common names, it is not found in India or Malaysia, but is endemic to Java and Sumatra of Indonesia. Like other members of its genus, it is remarkable for its strong resemblance to a dead leaf when its wings are folded. It was one of the species encountered by the British naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace in his travels in maritime Southeast Asia. It is mentioned in his famous 19th-century work ""The Malay Archipelago"" as one of the best examples of protective camouflage achieved through natural selection. <SEP> Hemigraphis is a genus of plants in the family Acanthaceae, consisting of about 30 species native to tropical Asia.

Context: Barbershop Digest is a full-color narrowcast niche publication, reaching African-American men across a diverse section of demographics. Revealing, entertaining and thought provoking, Barbershop Digest is a publication on the pulse of African-American men. <SEP> Dr. John Roderick 'Rod' Heller (born February 27, 1905, Fair Play, S.C., died May 4, 1989, Bethesda, Md., age 84, was the head in 1943-1948 of what was then called the ""Venereal Disease"" section of the United States Public Health Service (PHS). He then became the director of the National Cancer Institute, and then president/chief executive officer of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. He is best known for having been the assistant in charge of on-site medical operations in the Tuskegee syphilis study, a longitudinal clinical examination by PHS of untreated syphilis in U.S. African-American males. Very serious questions of medical ethics have been raised about this study and those involved in it. <SEP> The Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male, also known as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study or Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment ( ) was an infamous clinical study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the U.S. Public Health Service. The purpose of this study was to observe the natural progression of untreated syphilis in rural African-American men in Alabama under the guise of receiving free health care from the United States government. <SEP> Actinic keratosis (AK) is a pre-cancerous patch of thick, scaly, or crusty skin. These growths are more common in fair-skinned people and those who are frequently in the sun. They usually form when skin gets damaged by ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or indoor tanning beds. AKs are considered potentially pre-cancerous; left untreated, they may turn into a type of cancer called Squamous cell skin cancer. Untreated lesions have up to a 20% risk of progression to squamous cell carcinoma, so treatment by a dermatologist is recommended. <SEP> Congenital syphilis is syphilis present ""in utero"" and at birth, and occurs when a child is born to a mother with syphilis. Untreated early syphilis infections results in a high risk of poor pregnancy outcomes, including saddle nose, lower extremity abnormalities, miscarriages, premature births, stillbirths, or death in newborns. Some infants with congenital syphilis have symptoms at birth, but many develop symptoms later. Babies exposed ""in utero"" can have deformities, delays in development, or seizures along with many other problems such as rash, fever, an enlarged liver and spleen, anemia, and jaundice. Newborns will typically not develop a primary syphilitic chancre, but may present with signs of secondary syphilis (i.e. generalized body rash). Often these babies will develop syphilitic rhinitis (""snuffles""), the mucus from which is laden with the ""T. pallidum"" bacterium, and therefore highly infectious. Rarely, the symptoms of syphilis go unseen in infants so that they develop the symptoms of latent syphilis, including damage to their bones, teeth, eyes, ears, and brain. <SEP> Neurosyphilis is an infection of the brain or spinal cord caused by the spirochete ""Treponema pallidum"". It usually occurs in people who have had chronic, untreated syphilis, usually about 10 to 20 years after first infection and develops in about 25%–40% of persons who are not treated. The United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises that neurosyphilis can occur at any stage of a syphilis infection. <SEP> Bobby William Austin (born December 29, 1944) is an American sociologist, lecturer, and writer. He is a leading scholar on African-American men and boys and was the first person, as a Program Officer with the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, to fund major philanthropic initiatives for African-American men and boys. Over the past 30 years, in the fields of education, social policy, youth development, cultural theory, philanthropy and religion, he has created a series of structured venues as pathways for how citizens might live life in communities as individuals and as members of groups where peace, meaning, and innovation are nurtured. He is currently President of the Neighborhood Associates Corporation and Managing Director of the EducationThinkTank. <SEP> Natural Progression is a 2004 album by the Canadian hip hop group Sweatshop Union. Natural Progression established Sweatshop Union as a player in the conscious underground rap scene. <SEP> Prostate-specific transcript 1 (non-protein coding), also known as PCGEM1, is a long non-coding RNA gene. In humans, it is located on chromosome 2q32. It is over-expressed in prostate cancer. In a study of prostate tumours from 88 men, levels of PCGEM1 were found to be higher in prostate cancer cells in African-American men than in Caucasian-American men. The mortality rate of prostate cancer is highest in African-American men. <SEP> The Calhoun Colored School (1892–1945) was a private boarding and day school in Calhoun, Lowndes County, Alabama, about 28 mi southwest of the capital of Montgomery. Founded in 1892 by Miss Charlotte Thorn and Miss Mabel Dillingham in partnership with Booker T. Washington of Tuskegee Institute, to provide education to rural black students, who comprised the majority in this area, the Calhoun Colored School was first designed to educate rural African-American students according to the industrial school model common at the time."

October 29? 
Context: The November 2001 Atlantic Canada storm complex was a powerful coastal storm that included the remnants of North Atlantic hurricanes Michelle and Noel. The low intensified as it moved westward into Atlantic Canada on November 6, reaching a minimum pressure of 946 mbars. The storm turned to the northeast and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean on November 8. It produced strong winds throughout Atlantic Canada, including gusts of up to 96 mph (155 km/h) at the Confederation Bridge in Prince Edward Island. High waves caused damage along the coastlines, while high winds left up to 100,000 without power. Overall damage was minor, and no casualties were reported. <SEP> Cyclone Bijli (JTWC designation: 01B, also known as Cyclonic Storm Bijli), was the first tropical cyclone to form during the 2009 North Indian Ocean cyclone season. Bijli formed from an area of Low Pressure on April 14. Later that evening, RSMC New Delhi upgraded the low pressure area to a Depression and designated it as BOB 01. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) then issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert for the system and soon after designated it as Tropical Depression 01B. On the evening of April 15, both RSMC New Delhi and the JTWC reported that the system had intensified into a tropical storm, with the former naming it Bilji. Soon after, Bilji reached its peak intensity as it approached the coast of Bangladesh. However, on the morning of April 17, Bijli weakened to a deep depression due to land interaction, before making landfall just south of Chittagong. The remnants of Bilji continued to weaken as they tracked across northern Myanmar, before RSMC New Delhi issued their last advisory on April 18. The word Bijli refers to lightning in Hindi. <SEP> Hurricane Brenda of August 1973 was the first tropical cyclone on record to make landfall in the Mexican Province of Campeche.

Brenda had moved back over water by August 21 and began to quickly intensify, with an eye forming later that day. The storm peaked as an upper-end Category 1 hurricane with winds of 90 mph before making landfall in Campeche. The hurricane rapidly weakened after moving over land and dissipated the following day. <SEP> Hurricane Bertha caused minor damage in the United States, Bermuda, and Atlantic Canada in July and August 1990.

In what town is Suffolk county hamlet that was served by the Suffolk Traction Company?
Context: The Suffolk Traction Company is a former streetcar system in Suffolk County, New York. It operated primarily between Patchogue and Holtsville, but also included a route that served Blue Point, Bayport, and Sayville. It was opened in 1909 and ceased operations in 1919. <SEP> The North Western Road Car Company was a bus company in Stockport, England, formed in 1923 from the existing bus services of the British Automobile Traction Company Limited (itself a subsidiary of the British Electric Traction Company Limited) in Macclesfield. The company operated bus services in five counties (Cheshire, Lancashire, West Riding of Yorkshire, Derbyshire and Staffordshire) through a combination of growth and the acquisition of other bus companies, such as the takeover in 1924 of the Mid-Cheshire Motor Bus Company Limited, which brought new operations in Northwich and Flixton. The company also operated express coach services to London, North Wales and Yorkshire. <SEP> The Twin City Railroad Company was organized in 1912 as successor to the Twin City Light and Traction Company and acquired its subsidiaries, the Chehalis Electric and Traction Company and the Centralia Electric and Traction Company. The company operated the 6.6 mile electric line extending from Chehalis, Washington (the “Rose City”) to Centralia, Washington (the “Hub City”) until 1936. <SEP> New York State Route 29A (NY 29A) is a state highway in the western portion of the Capital District of New York in the United States. The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with NY 29 in the Herkimer County hamlet of Salisbury Center. Its eastern end is at another junction with NY 29 about 36 mi to the east near the Fulton County hamlet of Vail Mills. NY 29A enters Gloversville via Rose Street and continues through downtown on Fulton Street. <SEP> The Florida Interurban Railway and Tunnel Company was incorporated in 1912 by the Bates Real Estate Interests and partners, which had extensive backgrounds in railroading with the Seaboard Air Line Railroad. It is not known if the company was a 'front' for Seaboard expansion into new markets but the use of a front company has been a common practice in Florida. The railway was to link Jacksonville with both St. Augustine and Pablo Beach (later named: Jacksonville Beach) with a 45-mile rail network. The tunnel would have had the additional bonus of being the first man-made crossing of the St. Johns River and was planned for interurbans and streetcars as well as automobiles and pedestrians. The opening of the St. Elmo Acosta toll Bridge in 1921 connected both sides of the river and it was used by streetcars, automobiles and pedestrians. Nothing more was heard from the FIR&T Company, but several more interurban schemes played into the area's electric railway history. Jacksonville Traction Company itself incorporated the Duval Traction Company which in 1918 completed a line from downtown Jacksonville to Camp Johnston (today's NAS JAX) near the Clay County line. The South Jacksonville municipal Railways flush with cash after linking Jacksonville and South Jacksonville extended its lines to both St. Nicholas and San Jose, which was then considered 'far out in the country.' <SEP> The Peekskill Lighting and Railroad Company was a streetcar transit line operating in northern Westchester County and southern Putnam County. The earliest segment was constructed by the Peekskill Traction Company in 1899 running 5.5 miles from the New York Central Railroad train station at Peekskill to Lake Mohegan. The company was unable to meet payments for construction of the line, so the contractor operated the railroad until it was sold to the Peekskill Lighting and Railroad Company in 1900 (itself a consolidation of the Peekskill Gas Light Co., Peekskill Electric Light and Power Co., and the Peekskill Traction Co.). The associated Westchester and Putnam Traction Company built extensions beyond Lake Mohegan, though the two companies were operated as one. In 1902, an extension was constructed through Buchannan to Verplanck. Another extension was opened in 1907 to Cortlandville, and Varian's Mills (later Williams Corners) in 1908. The final extension to Oregon (Putnam Valley) opened in 1909. The first cutbacks came in 1924, followed by the closure of the Putnam Valley extension in 1925. The remaining track around Peekskill was closed in 1926. <SEP> The Ossining Electric Railway was a streetcar transit line that operated in northern Westchester County.

The new company announced an ambitious project to build a new line to White Plains as well as a route to Port Chester, but the only extension built was from Sparta Hill to Ossining Hospital. Westchester Traction Company took control of the Danbury and Harlem Traction Company project, which was only partially constructed between Danbury, Connecticut and North Salem, New York, and never put into operation. The ""Industrial Contracting Company"" was hired to construct the Danbury and Harlem line as well as the extension of the Ossining Electric Railway. Considerable grading and some track construction took place on the Danbury line, but no evidence of construction on the Ossining line could be found. <SEP> Northport Traction Company was a trolley service in the Town of Huntington in New York. It ran from 1902 to 1924 and served East Northport and Northport, New York. The company only had one line throughout its history which ran from Northport (LIRR station) to Northport Harbor, at what is today Cow Harbor Park.

An economic impact study released by the Boston Consulting Group in 2012 found that New York City's entertainment industry during Oliver's tenure as film commissioner had grown to account for a $7.1 billion annual direct spend in New York City, an increase of $2 billion since 2002, and that the local industry created 30,000 jobs in New York City since 2004, growing to employ 130,000 people.

In July 2010, Oliver became the commissioner of the Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment, the city agency that includes the Mayor's Office of Film, Theatre and Broadcasting, NYC Media, and NYC Digital. <SEP> Larry Mendte (born January 16, 1957) is an American news anchor, commentator and radio talk show host.

The two contestants, Elena Sinkevitch and Mari Jalonen, were both sent to a secret island. As a major twist this season, during the pre-merge portion of the game when a contestant was voted out they would move to a secret island where they would compete against two other contestants to remain in the game. The two contestants left on the secret island following the final duel, Elena Sinkevitch and Markku Markkanen, joined the other members of the merge tribe. The contestants were then divided up into two tribes known as ""Goal"" and ""Texas"". When it came time for the final four, the contestants took part in the infamous ""plank"" competition in which Jasna Preselj was eliminated and Markku Markkanen advanced to the final two. The other two contestants then took part in one more challenge in which Mira Jantunen won and advanced to the final two while Elena Sinkevitch was eliminated. The final two then took part in a duel which Mira Jantunen won and earned an extra jury vote for herself. Along with this, Mira also won the audience's jury vote. Ultimately, it was Mira Jantunen who won this season over Markku Markkanen by a unanimous jury vote of 11-0."

Context: Mountain dog is a generic form of dog, a group of similar or related dog breeds or landraces typically from mountain environs of central Eurasia. <SEP> Herding Group is the name of a breed group of dogs, used by kennel clubs to classify a defined collection of dog breeds. It does not refer to one particular type of dog. How the ""Herding Group"" is defined varies among kennel clubs, and different kennel clubs may not include the same breeds in their ""Herding Group"". Some kennel clubs do not use the term ""Herding Group"". The international kennel club association, the Fédération Cynologique Internationale, does not have a ""Herding Group"", and includes most pastoral dogs in Group 1 ""Sheepdogs and Cattle Dogs (except Swiss Cattle Dogs)"" and Group 2 ""Pinscher and Schnauzer - Molossoid Breeds - Swiss Mountain and Cattle Dogs"". <SEP> The Romanian Raven Shepherd Dog is a very large Romanian livestock guardian dog, taxonomized within the second group of dog breeds - Pinscher and Schanuzer - Molossoid Breeds - Swiss Mountain and Cattle Dogs, section 2.2: Molossoid Breeds - Mountain type. <SEP> Tugou (土狗, pinyin: ""tǔ gǒu""), literally means Native Dog in Mandarin Chinese, is the general name for several dog breeds originated from China and still abundantly exists across the country today.

They are roughly 45–50 cm tall at the shoulder. <SEP> Sennenhund, called Swiss mountain dogs or Swiss cattle dogs in English, are a type of dog originating in the Swiss Alps. The Sennenhund are farm dogs of the general molosser type. There are four breeds of Sennenhund, all sporting a unique tricolor coat. While the two larger ones share a heavy build and a calm temperament, the two smaller ones are more agile. The breeds range from medium in size to very large. The name Sennenhund refers to people called ""Senn"" or Senner, Swiss alpine herdsmen and dairymen, and does not translate as ""mountain"" or ""cattle"". <SEP> The Entlebucher Sennenhund or Entlebucher Mountain Dog is a medium-sized herding dog, it is the smallest of the four Sennenhunds, a dog type that includes four regional breeds. The name Sennenhund refers to people called ""Senn"", herders in the Swiss Alps. Entlebuch is a region in the canton of Lucerne in Switzerland. The breed is also known in English as the Entelbuch Mountain Dog, Entelbucher Cattle Dog, and similar combinations. <SEP> The Bernese Mountain Dog (German: ""Berner Sennenhund"" ) is a large-sized breed of dog, one of the four breeds of Sennenhund-type dogs from the Swiss Alps. The name ""Sennenhund"" is derived from the German ""Senne"" (""alpine pasture"") and ""Hund"" (""dog""), as they accompanied the alpine herders and dairymen called ""Senn"". ""Berner"" (or ""Bernese"" in English) refers to the area of the breed’s origin, in the canton of Bern. This mountain dog was originally kept as a general farm dog.

Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs are almost certainly the result of indigenous dogs mating with large mastiff types brought to Switzerland by foreign settlers. At one time, the breed was believed to have been among the most popular in Switzerland.

The need for such a list was first identified in June 2003, with research conducted by the KC to identify the extent of the vulnerability and viability of each breed. It was a joint project, with the KC working with the British and Irish Native Breeds Trust, later to be known simply as the Native Dog Breeds Trust.

Context: Helmuth Johann Ludwig von Moltke (] ; 23 May 1848 – 18 June 1916), also known as Moltke the Younger, was a nephew of ""Generalfeldmarschall"" (Field Marshal) Helmuth Karl Bernhard von Moltke and served as the Chief of the German General Staff from 1906 to 1914. The two are often differentiated as ""Moltke the Elder"" and ""Moltke the Younger"". <SEP> General Staff (Vietnamese: ""Bộ Tổng tham mưu"" ) is the commanding and managing organisation of the Vietnam People's Army, the paramilitary forces, militia and other activities relating to defence of Vietnam. The General Staff was established on 7 September 1945, right after the foundation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the first Chief of the General Staff was General Hoàng Văn Thái. During the Second Indochina War, Vietnam War, Cambodian-Vietnamese War, Sino-Vietnamese War and other skirmishes, the General Staff always had an essential role in organising, commanding the armed forces and planning, operating military campaigns for the Ministry of Defence and the Government of Vietnam. The current Chief of the General Staff is Senior Lieutenant General (AKA Colonel General) Phan Văn Giang who also holds the position of Deputy Minister of Defence. <SEP> Admirals Nunatak ( ) is a nunatak rising to 925 m on the upper Uranus Glacier, central Alexander Island, Antarctica. The name originates from dog teams named ""The Admirals"" that served at various British stations in Antarctica, 1952–94, and honors the loyal service of all Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey/BAS sled dogs. The nunatak appears to have some relation to Huns Nunatak which lies about 3.7 mi northeast of Admirals Nunatak. <SEP> Ludwig August Theodor Beck (29 June 1880 – 21 July 1944) was a German general and Chief of the German General Staff during the early years of the Nazi regime in Germany before World War II. Ludwig Beck was never a member of the Nazi Party, though in the early 1930s he supported Adolf Hitler's forceful denunciation of the Versailles Treaty and belief in the need for Germany to rearm. Beck had grave misgivings regarding the Nazi demand that all German officers swear an oath of fealty to the person of Hitler in 1934, though he believed that Germany needed strong government and that Hitler could successfully provide this so long as he was influenced by traditional elements within the military rather than the SA and SS. <SEP> Franz Halder (30 June 1884 – 2 April 1972) was a German general and the chief of the ""Oberkommando des Heeres"" staff (OKH, Army High Command) from 1938 until September 1942, when he was dismissed after frequent disagreements with Adolf Hitler. Until December 1941 Halder's military position corresponded to the old Chief of the General Staff position, which during World War I had been the highest military office in the German Imperial Army. Halder's diary during his time as chief of OKH General Staff has been a source for authors that have written about such subjects as Hitler, World War II and the Nazi Party. In William Shirer's ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"", Halder's diary is cited hundreds of times. <SEP> The Schlieffen Plan (German: ""Schlieffen-Plan"" , ] ) was the name given after World War I to the thinking behind the German invasion of France and Belgium on 4 August 1914. Field Marshal Alfred von Schlieffen, the Chief of the Imperial Army German General Staff from 1891 to 1906, devised a deployment plan for a war-winning offensive, in a one-front war against the French Third Republic from 1905–06.

He named it for General Helmuth von Moltke, Chief of the German General Staff and Secretary of State for Home Affairs. Surveys during the mid-1950s by British, Argentine and United States expeditions indicate that a group of four or five nunataks exist in the area. <SEP> The Chief of the General Staff (Ukrainian: Начальник Генерального штабу ) is the chief of staff of the General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. He/she is appointed by the President of Ukraine. If the Minister of Defense is a civilian the Chief of the General Staff becomes the commander-in-chief of the Ukrainian Armed Forces. The current Chief of the General Staff is Viktor Muzhenko. <SEP> The German General Staff, originally the Prussian General Staff and officially Great General Staff (""Großer Generalstab""), was a full-time body at the head of the Prussian Army and later, the German Army, responsible for the continuous study of all aspects of war, and for drawing up and reviewing plans for mobilization or campaign.

Johnson, who had successfully associated himself with Kennedy’s popularity, won 61.1% of the popular vote, the highest win by a candidate since James Monroe’s re-election in 1820. It was the most lopsided US presidential election in terms of popular votes, and the tenth-most lopsided presidential election in the history of the United States in terms of electoral votes. No candidate for president since has equalled or surpassed Johnson’s percentage of the popular vote, and since 1820, only Abraham Lincoln in 1864, Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936, Richard Nixon in 1972 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 and 1984 have won by a greater electoral vote margin. <SEP> The 1964 United States presidential election in Ohio was held on November 3, 1964.

Wilson's re-election marked the first time that a Democratic Party candidate had won two consecutive Presidential elections since Andrew Jackson won re-election in the 1832 election.

Context: The Moray Firth fishing disaster of August 1848 was one of the worst fishing disasters in maritime history on the east coast of Scotland, and was caused by a severe storm that struck the Moray Firth.

The cliffs here contain quartz; the name ""Findlater"" is derived not from Norse as earlier stated here, but from the Scots Gaelic words ""fionn"" (""white"") and ""leitir"" (""cliff or steep slope""). The first historical reference to the castle is from 1246. King Alexander III of Scotland repaired this castle in the 1260s in preparation for an invasion by King Haakon IV of Norway. The Vikings took and held the castle for some time. The castle remains that are still there are from the 14th-century rebuilding, when the castle was redesigned based on the Roslyn Castle model. <SEP> Findochty (pronounced ), Scots: ""Finichty"" , Scottish Gaelic: ""Am Fionn Ochdamh"" ) is a village in Moray, Scotland on the shores of the Moray Firth; historically it was part of Banffshire.

One of the earliest references to Findochty is in 1440, when the King granted Findachtifeild to John Dufe, son of John Dufe. The lands passed from the Duffs to the Ogilvies of Findlater and subsequently, in 1568, the Ord family acquired the manor, port, custom and fishers' lands of Findochty, and later built the House of Findochty, known as Findochty Castle, now a ruin, which stands to the west of the village.

Findochty expanded as a fishing port through the 1700s and 1800s, and by 1850 was home to 140 fishing boats. But the expansion in the late 1800s of nearby Buckie provided a better harbour, and some of the fishing fleet had left Findochty by 1890.

Therefore, three council areas have Moray Firth coastline: Highland to the west and north of the Moray Firth and Highland, Moray and Aberdeenshire to the south. The firth has more than 800 kilometres (about 500 miles) of coastline, much of which is cliff. <SEP> Forres Castle was a fort and castle built near Forres, Scotland. The fort was destroyed in 850 by Vikings. Forres was created a royal burgh by King David I of Scotland in 1140. The castle, once a royal castle, was built as a motte and bailey castle and was strengthened in the 14th century. It was demolished in 1297 by the adherents of Wallace. King William the Lion and King Alexander II of Scotland visited and stayed at the castle. King David II of Scotland stayed at the castle in 1346. It was burned by Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan in 1390. Held by the Dunbars of Westfield until the 17th century, it fell into ruins. Nothing now remains above ground. <SEP> Dover is an unincorporated community on the banks of Mission Creek in western Shawnee County, Kansas, United States. Founded in 1860, it was once a larger community, but it declined for most of the 20th century. Today a few commercial buildings remain at the intersection of K-4 Highway and 57th Street, but it is mainly a residential area. A newly founded Dover Community Foundation has been created to support the growth of the community and retention of its history. Camp Daisy Hindman, a rather large Girl Scout camp, is located 2 miles south of the town. 1½ miles west of town is a 50 ft high cliff known as Echo Cliff. <SEP> Fortrose (Scottish Gaelic: ""A' Chananaich"" , Scots: ""Chainry"" ) is a town and former burgh in the Scottish Highlands. It is on the Moray Firth, about 6 mi north-east of Inverness. The town is known for its ruined 13th century cathedral, and as the home of the Brahan Seer. In the Middle Ages it was the seat of the bishopric of Ross. The Cathedral was largely demolished in the mid-seventeenth century by Oliver Cromwell to provide building materials for a citadel at Inverness. The vaulted south aisle, with bell-tower, and a detached chapter house (used as the tollbooth of Fortrose after the Reformation) remain. These fragments, though modest in scale, display considerable architectural refinement, and are in the care of Historic Scotland (no entrance charge). The burgh is a popular location for trying to spot bottlenose dolphins (see Chanonry Point) in the Moray Firth. <SEP> Inverness ( ; from the Scottish Gaelic: ""Inbhir Nis"" ] , meaning ""Mouth of the River Ness"") is a city in the Scottish Highlands. It is the administrative centre for the Highland council area, and is regarded as the capital of the Highlands. Inverness lies near two important battle sites: the 11th-century battle of Blàr nam Fèinne against Norway which took place on The Aird and the 18th-century Battle of Culloden which took place on Culloden Moor. It is the northernmost city in the United Kingdom and lies within the Great Glen (Gleann Mòr) at its north-eastern extremity where the River Ness enters the Moray Firth. At the latest, a settlement was established by the 6th century with the first royal charter being granted by Dabíd mac Maíl Choluim (King David I) in the 12th century. The Gaelic king Mac Bethad Mac Findláich (MacBeth) whose 11th-century killing of King Duncan was immortalised in Shakespeare's largely fictionalized play ""Macbeth"", held a castle within the city where he ruled as Mormaer of Moray and Ross. <SEP> The Stotfield fishing disaster was the first of several fishing disasters of the 19th century on the east coast of Scotland. A storm struck the Moray Firth on 25 December 1806. Compared to the Moray Firth fishing disaster of 1848 or the Eyemouth Disaster of 1881, the Stotfield disaster was small. However, although in those major disasters many more lives and boats were lost, the effect at Stotfield was arguably worse. There, the village lost its entire fleet of three fishing boats. More importantly, it lost all of its able bodied men and youths in one afternoon."

Context: The Greater Manchester Army Cadet Force (GMACF) is the county cadet force for Greater Manchester which forms part of the wider Army Cadet Force, a youth organisation in the United Kingdom that offers learning and experiences around a military training theme. It is home to between 1400-1750 cadets and 200-230 adult volunteers in 45-47 detachments. GMACF headquarters is at Hawkshaw in Bury, and piping and parade nights are held at Hulme in Manchester. The Honorary Colonel of the GMACF is the Lord Lieutenant of Greater Manchester, Warren James Smith. <SEP> Ningxia wines are wines produced in the Chinese province of Ningxia (Chinese: 宁夏; pronounced ]). Wine grapes have been grown in the area since 1982, when large Chinese wine producers such as Changyu, Great Wall, and Dynasty established vineyards in the region. At that time, little wine was vinified in the region; rather, the grapes were shipped to more developed regions to be turned into wine. In the late 1990s, the Ningxia Agricultural Reclamation Management Bureau began a concerted effort to turn once arid land between the Yellow River and the Helan Mountain foothills into a potential site for vineyard development. From the mid 2000s onwards, Ningxia saw a steady increase in quality wine production, with international wine brands such as Pernod Ricard and LVMH investing in the area. Several boutique, Chinese-owned wineries also began operations in this period, including Helan Qingxue Winery and Silver Heights Vineyard. Following Helan Qingxue's surprise win at the Decanter Worldwide Wine Awards in 2011, Ningxia has seen an explosion of winery development. One unique viticultural feature of the region is the use of sand and earth to bury the vines in the winter, a labor-intensive practice necessary to protect the vines against the cold and dry months from November through March. <SEP> The Corps is a poetic hymn associated with the United States Military Academy. It is second in importance to only the Academy's ""Alma Mater"". The words were written by West Point Chaplain, Bishop H.S. Shipman, around 1902. The accompanying music was composed in 1910 specially for the ceremonial closing of the Old Cadet Chapel and opening of the new Cadet Chapel. ""The Corps"" was first sung on the steps of the Cadet Chapel on 12 June 1910, and became part of the graduation ceremony starting in 1911. Today, ""The Corps"" is typically sung by the Cadet Glee Club (West Point's choir) in companion to the Alma Mater at alumni gatherings, graduation, memorial ceremonies and funerals. <SEP> Cadet Holiday is a 11-minute 1951 Canadian documentary film, made by the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) as part of the postwar ""Canada Carries On"" series. The film, directed by David Bairstow, Robert Humble and Douglas Wilkinson, was produced by Sydney Newman and Michael Spencer. ""Cadet Holiday"" was an account of a Canadian Army Cadet during a summer camp. The film's French version title is ""Cadets en vacances"". <SEP> The Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg constitutes the House of Luxembourg-Nassau, headed by the sovereign Grand Duke, and in which the throne of the grand duchy is hereditary. It consists of heirs and descendants of the House of Nassau-Weilburg, whose sovereign territories passed cognatically from the Nassau dynasty to a cadet branch of the House of Bourbon-Parma, itself a branch of the Spanish Royal House which is agnatically a cadet branch of the House of Capet that originated in France. <SEP> The House of Valois (] ) was a cadet branch of the Capetian dynasty. They succeeded the House of Capet (or ""Direct Capetians"") to the French throne, and were the royal house of France from 1328 to 1589. Junior members of the family founded cadet branches in Orléans, Anjou, Burgundy, and Alençon. <SEP> The United States Air Force Academy Cadet Chapel, completed in 1962, is the distinguishing feature of the Cadet Area at the United States Air Force Academy north of Colorado Springs. It was designed by Walter Netsch of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill of Chicago. Construction was accomplished by Robert E. McKee, Inc., of Santa Fe, New Mexico. Originally controversial in its design, the Cadet Chapel has become a classic and highly regarded example of modernist architecture. The Cadet Chapel was awarded the American Institute of Architects' National Twenty-five Year Award in 1996 and, as part of the Cadet Area, was named a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 2004. <SEP> Mouton Cadet is the brand name of a popular range of modestly priced, generic Bordeaux wines, considered Bordeaux's most successful brand. Created by Baron Philippe de Rothschild, Mouton Cadet wine is produced through the assembly of a variety of grapes, from several Bordeaux region appellations. <SEP> The House of Barcelona was a medieval dynasty that ruled the County of Barcelona continuously from 878 and the Crown of Aragon from 1137 (as kings from 1162). From the male part they descend from the Bellonids, the descendants of Wifred the Hairy. They inherited most of the Catalan counties by the thirteenth century and established a territorial Principality of Catalonia, uniting it with the Kingdom of Aragon through marriage and conquering numerous other lands and kingdoms until the death of the last legitimate male of the main branch, Martin the Humanist, in 1410. Cadet branches of the house continued to rule Urgell (since 992) and Gandia. Cadet branches of the dynasty had also ruled Ausona intermittently from 878 until 1111, Provence from 1112 to 1245, and Sicily from 1282 to 1409. By the Compromise of Caspe of 1412 the Crown of Aragon passed to a branch of the House of Trastámara, descended from the ""infanta"" Eleanor of the house of Barcelona. <SEP> The Anscarids (Latin: ""Anscarii"" ) or the House of Ivrea were a medieval Frankish dynasty of Burgundian origin which rose to prominence in Italy in the tenth century, even briefly holding the Italian throne. They also ruled the County of Burgundy in the eleventh and twelfth centuries and it was one of their members who first declared himself a count palatine. A cadet branch ruled the Kingdom of Galicia from 1111 and the Kingdoms of Castile and León from 1126 until 1369. The House of Trastamara, which ruled in Castile, Aragon, Naples, and Navarre at various points between the late 14th and early 16th centuries, was an illegitimate cadet branch of the family."

Context: Silene menziesii is a species of flowering plant in the pink family known by the common names Menzies' campion and Menzies' catchfly. It is native to western North America from Alaska through the western half of Canada to the southwestern United States. It can be found in many types of habitat and it is quite common in much of its range. It is variable in morphology and there are a number of varied subtaxa. In general, it is a perennial herb growing from a caudex, appearing matlike, decumbent, or erect, with stems a few centimeters to over half a meter long. It is usually hairy in texture, with upper parts bearing sticky glandular hairs. The leaves are lance-shaped, oppositely arranged in pairs, and a few centimeters in length, upper leaves usually smaller than lower. Flowers may occur in a cyme at the top of the stem, or in leaf axils, or both. Each is encapsulated in a hairy, veined calyx of fused sepals. The petals are white with two lobes at the tips. The plant is dioecious with male and female plants producing different flowers. The male and female flower types look the same externally; the stamens are reduced in female plants and the stigmas are reduced in the male. <SEP> Silene stenophylla is a species of flowering plant in the family Caryophyllaceae. Commonly called narrow-leafed campion, it is a species in the genus ""Silene"". It grows in the Arctic tundra of far eastern Siberia and the mountains of Northern Japan. Frozen samples, estimated via radiocarbon dating to be around 32,000 years old, were discovered in the same area as current living specimens, and in 2012 a team of scientists successfully regenerated a plant from the samples. <SEP> Silene tomentosa, the Gibraltar campion, is a very rare flowering plant of the genus ""Silene"" and the family Caryophyllaceae. It is a woody-based perennial about 40cm high, with bilobed flowers ranging from pink to pale violet and is endemic to Gibraltar. <SEP> Silene oregana is a species of flowering plant in the pink family known by the common names Oregon silene, Oregon campion and Oregon catchfly. It is native to the western United States, including the Great Basin, where it grows in habitat such as sagebrush and forests. It is a perennial herb growing from a woody caudex and taproot, sending up an erect, mostly unbranched stem which may be 70 centimeters tall. The lance-shaped leaves are up to 8 centimeters long around the caudex, and shorter farther up the stem. Flowers occur in a terminal cyme and sometimes in leaf axils. Each flower is encapsulated in a hairy, glandular calyx of fused sepals. The five petals are creamy white or pink-tinged in color and each has four to six long, fringelike lobes at the tip. <SEP> Silene noctiflora is a species of flowering plant in the pink family known by the common names night-flowering catchfly, nightflowering silene and clammy cockle. It is native to Eurasia, but it is known on other continents as an introduced species and sometimes a weed. In North America, it is a common weed of grain crops in the Canadian prairie provinces and in much of the United States. It grows in fields and in other disturbed habitat. <SEP> ""Silene"" are a flowering plant that evolved a dioecious reproductive system. This is made possible through heteromorphic sex chromosomes expressed as XY. ""Silene"" recently evolved sex chromosomes 5-10 million years ago and are widely used by geneticists and biologists to study the mechanisms of sex determination since they are one of only 39 species across 14 families of angiosperm that possess sex-determining genes. ""Silene"" are studied because of their ability to produce offspring with a plethora of reproductive systems. The common inference drawn from such studies is that the sex of the offspring is determined by the Y chromosome. <SEP> Silene conoidea is a species of flowering plant in the pink family known by the common names weed silene and large sand catchfly. It is native to Eurasia, and it is known in other parts of the world, such as western North America, as a weed. It is an annual herb growing up to a meter in height with a hairy, partially glandular stem. The lance-shaped leaves are up to 12 centimeters long near the base of the plant and smaller farther up. The flower is enclosed in an inflated, hairy, glandular calyx of fused sepals which is ridged with many veins. It is open at the top, revealing five bright pink petals. <SEP> Silene antirrhina is a species of flowering plant in the pink family known by the common names sleepy silene and sleepy catchfly. It is native to the Americas, where it is widespread throughout North America and parts of South America. It is known in Europe as an introduced species. <SEP> Silene suksdorfii is a species of flowering plant in the pink family known by the common names Suksdorf's silene, Suksdorf's catchfly and Cascade alpine campion. It is native to the Pacific Northwest of the United States, where it occurs from Washington and Idaho to northern California. It is mainly an alpine species, growing in the talus of high mountain slopes. It can also be found below the tree line in forested subalpine habitat. It is a squat perennial herb producing several erect stems from a leafy, woody caudex. It generally takes a clumpy form. The stems grow up to 10 or 15 centimeters tall and are hairy in texture, with glandular, sticky areas on the upper parts. The leaves occur in tufts around the caudex. They are fleshy and coated in soft hairs. Solitary flowers arise on erect peduncles. Each is encapsulated in an inflated calyx of fused sepals, which is starkly purple-veined and has purplish glandular hairs. The petals are white or purple-tinged and have two lobes at their tips and appendages at their bases. <SEP> Silene latifolia (formerly ""Melandrium album""), the white campion is a dioecious flowering plant in the family Caryophyllaceae, native to most of Europe, Western Asia and Northern Africa. It is a herbaceous annual, occasionally biennial or a short-lived perennial plant, growing to between 40-80 centimetres tall. It is also known in the USA as bladder campion but should not be confused with ""Silene vulgaris"", which is more generally called Bladder Campion."

Formerly, she has been a news reporter and a private detective. <SEP> According to Tatin Yang in the article ""Romansang Pinoy: A day with Tagalog romance novels"", Tagalog romance paperbacks were thin Philippine versions of romance novel books that could be found at the bottom shelves of the romance section of bookstores, wrapped and bound with book covers that are decorated with Philippine comics-styled illustrations, such as ""a barrio landscape with a badly dressed guy and girl locked in an embrace"". As a form of ""escapist fiction"" (escapism) and ""commercial literature"", Tagalog romance novels generally follow a ""strict romance formula"", meaning the narratives have happy endings (a factor influencing the salability of the novel), the protagonists are wealthy, good-looking, smart, and characters that cannot die. Normally, the hero or heroine of the story falls in love and ""goes crazy"" over the admired person. However, later authors of Tagalog romance novels deviated from portraying so-called ""damsel-in-distress and knight-in-shining-armor characters"". Contemporary writers also turned away from writing ""rags-to-riches plots"". The stereotypical norm had been replaced by the incorporation of storylines with ""interesting scenes, characters [who are ready to face challenges or to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of other people], dialogues, and new angles to old plots"". Authors such as Maria Teresa Cruz San Diego, who used the pen names Maia Jose and Tisha Nicole, ventured into the fantasy romance genre, and into topics that are related to politics, ecology, gender issues, prostitution, mail-order bride syndicates, white slavery, non-governmental organizations, and breastfeeding programs. Apart from writing about ideal lovers (men and women) and ideal situations, other novelists wrote about true-to-life settings, or at least based the stories from personal experiences. Thus, Tagalog romance novels came to mirror or replicate the ""roles that women and men play"" in Philippine society."

Context: Breeching was the occasion when a small boy was first dressed in breeches or trousers. From the mid-16th century until the late 19th or early 20th century, young boys in the Western world were unbreeched and wore gowns or dresses until an age that varied between two and eight.

Dr. Johnston states, ""The human brain did not evolve to accurately represent the world around us; it evolved only to enhance the survival of our genes."" According to Johnston, the combination of emotions with symbolic thought produces meaning. But with this capacity comes the ability to develop meanings for things that do not exist. Little girls develop the ability to attach emotional feelings to dolls, and pretend that their toys live. Little boys learn how to pretend to hunt and fight and attach emotions to them. We learn feelings of desire, fear, and wonder by wandering to the limits of our play. Imagination allows us to create technology, mathematics, and art, but with it can also come terrifying thoughts that could cause harm to us. We grow to learn the difference between most of our thoughts and what they represent, but most of us get fooled into believing the reality of some things that don't exist at all. <SEP> The My Buddy doll line was a toy brand made by Hasbro in 1985 with the intention of making a doll to appeal to little boys and teach them about caring for their friends. This idea was both innovative and controversial for its time, as toy dolls were traditionally associated with younger girls. Hasbro also introduced a companion Kid Sister marketed toward girls. Hasbro discontinued the line before the start of the 1990s and Playskool took over production, making changes to the likeness and clothing. <SEP> Little Girls is a Canadian indie rock band formed in 2008 from Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The band emerged from Toronto's post-punk scene as a solo recording project of multi-instrumentalist Josh McIntyre. With a focus on Minimalist Electronic, Little Girls released CULTS EP (September 6, 2011) on Hand Drawn Dracula and are currently working on their second full-length record. <SEP> A teru teru bōzu (Japanese: てるてる坊主 , lit. ""shine shine monk"") is a small traditional handmade doll made of white paper or cloth that Japanese farmers began hanging outside of their window by a string. In shape and construction they are essentially identical to ghost dolls, such as those made at Halloween. This talisman is supposed to have magical powers to bring good weather and to stop or prevent a rainy day. ""Teru"" is a Japanese verb which describes sunshine, and a ""bōzu"" is a Buddhist monk (compare the word bonze), or in modern slang, ""bald-headed""; ""bōzu"" is also used as a term of endearment for addressing little boys."

Context: The Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) was a United States federal agency under the Department of the Treasury that chartered, supervised, and regulated all federally chartered and state-chartered savings banks and savings and loans associations. It was created in 1989 as a renamed version of another federal agency (that was faulted for its role in the savings and loan crisis). Like other U.S. federal bank regulators, it was paid by the banks it regulated. The OTS was initially seen as an aggressive regulator, but was later lax. Declining revenues and staff led the OTS to market itself to companies as a lax regulator in order to get revenue. <SEP> The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is an independent federal agency created as the successor regulatory agency of the Federal Housing Finance Board (FHFB), the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development government-sponsored enterprise mission team, absorbing the powers and regulatory authority of both entities, with expanded legal and regulatory authority, including the ability to place government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) into receivership or conservatorship. <SEP> Ministry for Atomic Energy of the Russian Federation and Federal Agency on Atomic Energy (or Rosatom), were a Russian federal executive body in 1992-2008 (as Federal Ministry in 1992-2004 and as Federal Agency in 2004-2008). <SEP> The Federal Register, abbreviated FR or sometimes Fed. Reg., is the official journal of the federal government of the United States that contains government agency rules, proposed rules, and public notices. It is published daily, except on federal holidays. The final rules promulgated by a federal agency and published in the ""Federal Register"" are ultimately reorganized by topic or subject matter and codified in the ""Code of Federal Regulations"" (CFR), which is updated annually. <SEP> The Federal Agency for Civic Education, FACE (German: Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung , bpb) is a German federal government agency responsible for promoting civic education. It is subordinated to the Federal Ministry of the Interior. Thomas Krüger has served as President of the agency since 2000. <SEP> Myloh Jaqory Mason (born June 28, 1990) is an American man who was listed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) of the United States within the FBI list of the ten most wanted persons for crimes alleged committed. Mason is described by the FBI as a violent felon. <SEP> Executive Order 12148 was an executive order enacted by President Jimmy Carter on July 20, 1979 to transfer and reassign duties to the newly formed agency, known as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), created by Executive Order 12127. The order combined several federal agencies tasked with emergency preparedness and civil defense spread across the executive departments into a unified entity that was established as an independent agency, free of Cabinet interference, with authority as the lead federal agency in a presidentially-declared disaster. <SEP> Turner Broadcasting v. Federal Communications Commission, 512 U.S. 622 (1994), is the first of two United States Supreme Court cases dealing with the must carry rules imposed on cable television companies. ""Turner Broadcasting v. Federal Communications Commission (II)"", 520 U.S. 180 (1997) was the second. ""Turner I"" established that cable television companies were indeed First Amendment speakers but didn't decide whether the federal regulation of their speech infringed upon their speech rights. In ""Turner II"" the court decided that the must carry provisions were constitutional. Under the ""Miami Herald v. Tornillo"" case, it was unconstitutional to force a newspaper to run a story the editors would not have included absent a government statute because it was compelled speech which could not pass the strict scrutiny of a compelling state interest being achieved with the least restrictive means necessary to achieve the state interest. However, under the rule of ""Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC"" the High Court held that a federal agency could regulate broadcast stations (TV and Radio) with far greater discretion. In order for federal agency regulation of broadcast media to pass constitutional muster, it need only serve an important state interest and need not narrowly tailor its regulation to the least restrictive means. <SEP> Civil forfeiture in the United States, also called civil asset forfeiture or civil judicial forfeiture or occasionally civil seizure, is a controversial legal process in which law enforcement officers take assets from persons suspected of involvement with crime or illegal activity without necessarily charging the owners with wrongdoing. While civil procedure, as opposed to criminal procedure, generally involves a dispute between two private citizens, civil forfeiture involves a dispute between law enforcement and ""property"" such as a pile of cash or a house or a boat, such that the thing is suspected of being involved in a crime. To get back the seized property, owners must prove it was not involved in criminal activity. Sometimes it can mean a threat to seize property as well as the act of seizure itself. In 2015, Eric Holder ended 'adoptive forfeiture' which occurred ""when a state or local law enforcement agency seizes property pursuant to state law and requests that a federal agency take the seized asset and forfeit it under federal law"" due to abuse. States proceeded to curtail the powers of police to seize assets, actions by the justice department in July 2017 have sought to reinstate police seizure powers to raise funding for federal agencies and local law enforcement. <SEP> Abdul Rauf is a commander of the militant Pakistani group Jaish-e-Mohammed, based mainly in the Pakistan-administered portion of the state of Kashmir and also in Afghanistan. The younger brother of Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar, he was involved in the hijacking of an Indian Airlines Flight 814 and is one of the most wanted persons in India due to his history of militant activities."

Supp. 2d 707, Docket No. 4cv2688) was the first direct challenge brought in the United States federal courts testing a public school district policy that required the teaching of intelligent design. In October 2004, the Dover Area School District of York County, Pennsylvania, changed its biology teaching curriculum to require that intelligent design be presented as an alternative to evolution theory, and that ""Of Pandas and People"", a textbook advocating intelligent design, was to be used as a reference book. The prominence of this textbook during the trial was such that the case is sometimes referred to as the Dover Panda Trial, a name which recalls the popular name of the Scopes Monkey Trial in Tennessee, 80 years earlier. The plaintiffs successfully argued that intelligent design is a form of creationism, and that the school board policy violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The judge's decision sparked considerable response from both supporters and critics. <SEP> Signature in the Cell: DNA and the Evidence for Intelligent Design is a 2009 book about intelligent design by philosopher and intelligent design advocate Stephen C. Meyer. The book was well received by some within the conservative, intelligent design and evangelical communities, but several other reviewers were critical and wrote that Meyer's claims are incorrect. <SEP> Creationism's Trojan Horse: The Wedge of Intelligent Design is a 2004 book by Barbara Forrest and Paul R. Gross on the origins of intelligent design, specifically the Discovery Institute's Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture and its wedge strategy. The authors are highly critical of what they refer to as intelligent design creationism, and document the intelligent design movement's fundamentalist Christian origins and funding. <SEP> William Albert ""Bill"" Dembski (born July 18, 1960) is an American mathematician, philosopher and theologian. A proponent of intelligent design (ID), specifically the concept of specified complexity, he was previously a senior fellow of the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture (CSC). On September 23, 2016 he announced his official retirement from intelligent design, resigning all his ""formal associations with the ID community, including [his] Discovery Institute fellowship of 20 years."" <SEP> Uncommon Dissent: Intellectuals Who Find Darwinism Unconvincing is a 2004 anthology edited by William A. Dembski in which fifteen intellectuals, eight of whom are leading intelligent design proponents associated with the Discovery Institute's Center for Science and Culture (CSC) and the International Society for Complexity, Information and Design (ISCID), criticise ""Darwinism"" and make a case for intelligent design. It is published by the publishing wing of the paleoconservative Intercollegiate Studies Institute. The foreword is by John Wilson, editor of the evangelical Christian magazine ""Christianity Today"". The title is a pun on the principle of biology known as common descent. The Discovery Institute is the engine behind the intelligent design movement. <SEP> The Design Inference: Eliminating Chance through Small Probabilities is a 1998 book by American philosopher and mathematician William A. Dembski, a proponent of intelligent design, which sets out to establish approaches by which evidence of intelligent agency could be inferred in natural and social situations. In the book he distinguishes between 3 general modes of competing explanations in order of priority: regularity, chance, and design. The processes in which regularity, chance, and design are ruled out one by one until one remains as a reasonable and sufficient explanation for an event, are what he calls an ""explanatory filter"". It is a method that tries to eliminate competing explanations in a systematic fashion including when a highly improbable event conforms to a discernible pattern that is given independently of the event itself. This pattern is Dembski's concept of specified complexity. Throughout the book he uses diverse examples such as detectability of spontaneous generation and occurrence of natural phenomena and cases of deceit like ballot rigging, plagiarism, falsification of data, etc. <SEP> Specified complexity is a concept proposed by William Dembski and used by him and others to promote the pseudoscientific arguments of intelligent design. According to Dembski, the concept can formalize a property that singles out patterns that are both ""specified"" and ""complex"", in specific senses defined by Dembski. Dembski states that specified complexity is a reliable marker of design by an intelligent agent—a central tenet to intelligent design, which Dembski argues for in opposition to modern evolutionary theory. The concept of specified complexity is widely regarded as mathematically unsound and has not been the basis for further independent work in information theory, in the theory of complex systems, or in biology. Proponents of intelligent design use specified complexity as one of their two main arguments, alongside irreducible complexity."

It might be played during a larger cash game session, where the game is breaking up and only two players remain on the table, or where two players are trying to start a game and playing heads-up while waiting for other opponents. It is also a necessary phase in most sit-and-go (SNG) poker tournaments; the single remaining tournament winner will at some point have to face only a single opponent. Alternatively, heads up poker may be played on purpose, either in a cash game format, or as a SNG, where two players play a winner-take-all tournament for a fixed, previously agreed upon amount of money. On larger online poker rooms and during certain tournament series, one may stumble upon larger heads up tournaments, usually in the shoot-out format.

In 2010, the WSOP expanded overseas once again, only this time to Gauteng, South Africa.

This breed is NOT recognized by the American Kennel Club. The chizer has a combination of looks from both breeds of dogs, and can vary depending upon the breakdown of the breed. General sizes of a chizer range between 6-14 inches in height and approximately 4-15-lbs in weight. The chizer is a small breed dog, and works great in smaller areas, such as apartments, condos, and townhomes. The chizer comes in a typical variety of colours, usually grey, black, brown or white. This breed has a smooth, short haired coat that needs constant grooming, trimming around the eyes, ears and nose. They are usually low to average shedding dogs, and typically most groomers leave their facial hair to mimic a schnauzer beard. The ears of a chizer are medium in length and can stand erect when at attention, and their tail is usually docked. The chizer can have either an apple shaped head, or round head, with either a long or short snout, giving it either the appearance of a Chihuahua or Miniature Schnauzer. The body of the chizer is generally long and lean, with slender legs, and a square, robust back end. This back end tends to make the dog sturdier, and gives them surprising jumping abilities to reach great heights."

Context: Groupe de femmes, also called Groupe de trois femmes, or Groupe de trois personnages, is an early Cubist sculpture created circa 1911 by the Hungarian avant-garde, sculptor, and graphic artist Joseph Csaky (1888–1971). This sculpture formerly known from a black and white photograph (Galerie René Reichard) had been erroneously entitled ""Deux Femmes (Two Women)"", as the image captured on an angle showed only two figures. An additional photograph found in the Csaky family archives shows a frontal view of the work, revealing three figures rather than two. Csaky's sculpture was exhibited at the 1912 Salon d'Automne, and the 1913 Salon des Indépendants, Paris. A photograph taken of Salle XI ""in sitiu"" at the 1912 Salon d'Automne and published in ""L'Illustration"", 12 October 1912, p. 47, shows ""Groupe de femmes"" exhibited alongside the works of Jean Metzinger, František Kupka, Francis Picabia, Amedeo Modigliani and Henri Le Fauconnier. <SEP> Louis Valtat (] ; 8 August 1869 – 2 January 1952) was a French painter and printmaker associated with the Fauves (""the wild beasts"", so named for their wild use of color), who first exhibited together in 1905 at the Salon d'Automne. <SEP> Pierre Bonnard (] ; 3 October 1867 — 23 January 1947) was a French painter and printmaker, as well as a founding member of the Post-Impressionist group of avant-garde painters Les Nabis. Bonnard preferred to work from memory, using drawings as a reference, and his paintings are often characterized by a dreamlike quality. The intimate domestic scenes, for which he is perhaps best known, often include his wife Marthe de Meligny. <SEP> Jean-Édouard Vuillard (] ; 11 November 186821 June 1940) was a French painter and printmaker associated with the Nabis. <SEP> Maurice Denis (] ; 25 November 1870 – 13 November 1943) was a French painter and writer, and a member of the Symbolist and Les Nabis movements. His theories contributed to the foundations of cubism, fauvism, and abstract art. <SEP> Danseuse au café (also known as Dancer in a Café or Au Café Concert and Danseuse) is a large oil painting created in 1912 by the French artist and theorist Jean Metzinger (1883–1956). The work was exhibited in Paris at the Salon d'Automne of 1912, entitled ""Danseuse"". The Cubist contribution to the 1912 Salon d'Automne created a controversy in the Municipal Council of Paris, leading to a debate in the Chambre des Députés about the use of public funds to provide the venue for such 'barbaric' art. The Cubists were defended by the Socialist deputy, Marcel Sembat. This painting was realized as Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, in preparation for the Salon de la Section d'Or, published a major defence of Cubism, resulting in the first theoretical essay on the new movement, ""Du «Cubisme»"". ""Danseuse au café"" was first reproduced in a photograph published in an article entitled ""Au Salon d'Automne ""Les Indépendants"""" in the French newspaper """", 2 Octobre 1912. The painting is now located at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo New York. <SEP> 20th-century art—and what it became as modern art—began with modernism in the late 19th century. Nineteenth-century movements of Post-Impressionism (Les Nabis), Art Nouveau and Symbolism led to the first twentieth-century art movements of Fauvism in France and Die Brücke (""The Bridge"") in Germany. Fauvism in Paris introduced heightened non-representational colour into figurative painting. Die Brücke strove for emotional Expressionism. Another German group was Der Blaue Reiter (""The Blue Rider""), led by Kandinsky in Munich, who associated the ""blue rider"" image with a spiritual non-figurative mystical art of the future. Kandinsky, Kupka, R. Delaunay and Picabia were pioneers of abstract (or non-representational) art. Cubism, generated by Picasso, Braque, Metzinger, Gleizes and others rejected the plastic norms of the Renaissance by introducing multiple perspectives into a two-dimensional image.

A disciple of Paul Gauguin and friend of Paul Sérusier, he belonged to the circle of artists known as 'Les Nabis.' Of a Dutch anabaptist background, his artistic and spiritual journey led him to convert to Roman Catholicism, and to take Holy Orders as a Benedictine monk, taking the religious name Willibrord. He entered the Archabbey of Beuron and continued his work in a religious context, working closely with Desiderius Lenz, leader of the Beuron Art School.

Finch, born April 11, 1902 in Dade City, Florida, is considered one of the pioneers in United States aviation history. He began his military career during World War 1, enlisting in the Aviation Section of the Army's Signal Corps in 1918. He remained in the Reserve Corps after the war, and in 1926, became Commander, 27th Pursuit Squadron, 1st Pursuit Group. In 1940, Georgia Governor Ed Rivers commissioned him to form the first flying unit of the Georgia Air National Guard. The unit was mobilized into the U.S. Army in September, 1941, with Major Finch as commander. After World War II, he was a leading critic of efforts to eliminate the air arm of the National Guard during peacetime. General Finch gained the respect and admiration of Air National Guardsmen throughout the nation with his steadfast support and successful efforts to preserve the Air Guard. He became the first Chief of the Air Force Division of the National Guard Bureau in 1948. Under his leadership, the Air National Guard built to combat readiness and was among the first components called into service after the outbreak of the Korean War. As a result of General Finch's vision and perseverance, 45,000 highly trained officers and airmen of 22 wings and 65 squadrons gave the Air Force the strength it needed in the early, critical phases of the Communist drive down the Korean peninsula.General Finch served as the senior Air Force member of the United Nations negotiating team at the peace talks at Panmunjom, Korea, and received the Legion of Merit for outstanding service in 1955; General Finch assumed command of Fourteenth Air Force, Robins AFB, Georgia, becoming the nation's first Air National Guardsman to head a numbered air force. General Finch had a career of ""firsts"" including the US Army's first night landing with a single, five-million-candlepower floodlight in 1927. He also established and endowed the General John P. McConnell Award at the United States Air Force Academy. Considered by many as the father of the strong, independent Air National Guard existing today, General Finch retired in 1957.

Finch.A graduate of the University of Georgia and a member of the Georgia Bar, General Finch was enshrined in the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame May 18, 1996. <SEP> Jean-Paul Paloméros (born 13 August 1953 in Paris) is a retired general of the French Air Force and served as Supreme Allied Commander Transformation, a senior military post in NATO.

Plaintiff Cecilia Barnes made claims arising out of Defendant Yahoo!, Inc.'s alleged failure to honor promises to remove offensive content about the plaintiff posted by a third party. The content consisted of a personal profile with nude photos of the Plaintiff and her contact information. The United States District Court for the District of Oregon had dismissed Barnes' complaint. <SEP> Capron v. Van Noorden, 6 U.S. 126 (1804) , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court allowed a plaintiff to dismiss a case that he had lost at trial because of a lack of diversity jurisdiction, leaving the plaintiff free to bring the case again. <SEP> Taiwan is primarily a destination for men, women, and children trafficked for the purposes of forced labor and sexual exploitation. It is also a source of women trafficked to Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Women and girls from the People’s Republic of China (P.R.C.) and Southeast Asian countries are trafficked to Taiwan through fraudulent marriages, deceptive employment offers, and illegal smuggling for sexual exploitation and forced labor. Many trafficking victims are workers from rural areas of Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines, employed through recruitment agencies and brokers to perform low skilled work in Taiwan’s construction, fishing, and manufacturing industries, or to work as domestic servants. Such workers are often charged high job placement and service fees, up to $14,000, resulting in substantial debt that labor brokers or employers use as a tool for involuntary servitude. Many foreign workers remain vulnerable to trafficking because legal protections, oversight by authorities and enforcement efforts are inadequate. Taiwan authorities reported that traffickers continued to use fraudulent marriages to facilitate labor and sex trafficking, despite increased efforts by the authorities to prevent this practice. Some women who are smuggled onto Taiwan to seek illegal work were sometimes sold in auctions to sex traffickers, and subsequently forced to work in the commercial sex industry. NGOs reported a sharp increase during the reporting period in the number of boys rescued from prostitution, mainly discovered during police investigations of online social networking sites suspected of being front operations for prostitution rings. <SEP> Market share liability is a legal doctrine that allows a plaintiff to establish a prima facie case against a group of product manufacturers for an injury caused by a product, even when the plaintiff does not know from which defendant the product originated. The doctrine is unique to the law of the United States and apportions liability among the manufacturers according to their share of the market for the product giving rise to the plaintiff's injury. <SEP> El Abayarde is the debut album by the Puerto Rican rapper Tego Calderón. It included the singles ""Pa' Que Retozen"", ""Guasa Guasa"" and ""Al Natural"". It was originally released 2002 through White Lion Records selling over 75,000 copies its first week between Puerto Rico and some parts of the United States. Despite heavy bootlegging internationally due to the album's lack of availability worldwide it was still able to sell over 300,000 copies. It would eventually be internationally distributed by Sony BMG in 2003. ""El Abayarde"" was nominated for a Lo Nuestro Award for Urban Album of the Year. <SEP> Edith ""Edie"" Windsor (née Schlain; June 20, 1929 – September 12, 2017) was an American LGBT rights activist and a technology manager at IBM. She was the lead plaintiff in the Supreme Court of the United States case ""United States v. Windsor"", which successfully overturned Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act and was considered a landmark legal victory for the same-sex marriage movement in the United States. <SEP> The Grant Commercial Historic District is a nationally recognized historic district located in Grant, Iowa, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. At the time of its nomination it contained 17 resources, which included 15 contributing buildings, two contributing structures, and one non-contributing building. The historic district covers the town's central business district. Grant is a small town located in northeast Montgomery County in the southwest quadrant of the state. It was plated in 1858, and it was known as Milford until the early 20th century even though its post office was Grant. While not on a railroad, the town was still able to maintain a viable commercial district. <SEP> Sea turtle migration refers to the long-distance movements of sea turtles (superfamily Chelonioidea) notably as adults but may also refer to the offshore migration of hatchings. Sea turtle hatchings emerge from underground nests and crawl across the beach towards the sea. They then maintain an offshore heading until they reach the open sea. The feeding and nesting sites of adult sea turtles are often distantly separated meaning some must migrate hundreds or even thousands of kilometres. Several main patterns of adult migration have been identified. Some such as the green sea turtle shuttle between nesting sites and coastal foraging areas. The loggerhead sea turtle uses a series of foraging sites. Others such as the leatherback sea turtle and olive ridley sea turtle do not show fidelity to any specific coastal foraging site. Instead, they forage in the open sea in complex movements apparently not towards any goal. Although the foraging movements of leatherbacks seem to be determined to a large part by passive drift with the currents, they are still able to return to specific sites to breed. The ability of adult sea turtles to travel to precise targets has led many to wonder about the navigational mechanisms used. Some have suggested that juvenile and adult turtles might use the Earth's magnetic field to determine their position. There is evidence for this ability in juvenile green sea turtles. <SEP> Gin Chow (1857 - June 1933) was a Chinese immigrant who gained fame in California as a prophet and fortune teller able to predict the weather and other natural events. Chow is credited with successfully predicting the 1925 Santa Barbara earthquake. Chow was also the main plaintiff in the California Supreme Court case ""Gin Chow v. City of Santa Barbara"" which still ranks as one of the most important water rights cases in the state."

Context: The Allied invasion of Italy was the Allied amphibious landing on mainland Italy that took place on 3 September 1943 during the early stages of the Italian Campaign of World War II. The operation was undertaken by General Sir Harold Alexander's 15th Army Group (comprising General Mark W.

It was San Jose's second MLS Cup victory in three years. It was the first MLS Cup in which players from both teams were allowed to wear their primary uniforms. It was also the first MLS Cup played between two former MLS Cup champions as well as the highest-scoring final, with 6 goals in total. <SEP> The Resistance Tour was a worldwide concert tour by English alternative rock band Muse in support of their fifth studio album ""The Resistance"". The opening European leg began on 22 October 2009 and ended on 4 December 2009, comprising 30 shows. The second leg, which began on 7 January 2010, included thirteen shows, seven of which were part of the Australasian Big Day Out shows. A North American leg of 26 shows took place in early 2010. Nine stadium shows took place in Europe in 2010, with three of those dates taking place at Wembley Stadium and Old Trafford Cricket Ground. A second round of North American concerts took place throughout September and October 2010. These dates focused on secondary markets and other areas not previously hit on the tour. A return to Australasia took place throughout December 2010 and Muse are confirmed as openers for U2's 360° Tour dates in South America in spring 2011 and also played further European shows in the summer of 2011.

Kubiak still holds the Brewers' record for most RBIs in a single game, seven (later equalled by Jose Hernandez and Richie Sexson), which he set at Boston on July 18, 1970, the team's first year in Milwaukee. The record is all the more remarkable given that Kubiak was not known for his batting. <SEP> The Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty (Chinese: 中日和平條約 ), commonly known as the Treaty of Taipei (), was a peace treaty between Japan and the Republic of China (ROC) signed in Taipei, Taiwan on April 28, 1952, and took effect on August 5 the same year, marking the formal end of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–45). This treaty was necessary, because neither the Republic of China nor the People's Republic of China was invited to sign the Treaty of San Francisco due to disagreements by other countries as to which government was the legitimate government of China during and after the Chinese Civil War. Under pressure from the United States, Japan signed a separate peace treaty with the Republic of China to bring the war between the two states to a formal end with a victory for the ROC. Although the ROC itself was not a participant in the San Francisco Peace Conference due to the resumption of the Chinese Civil War after 1945, this treaty largely corresponds to that of San Francisco. In particular, the ROC waived service compensation to Japan in this treaty with respect to Article 14(a).1 of the San Francisco Treaty. <SEP> Strikeforce: Shamrock vs. Gracie was the inaugural mixed martial arts event promoted by Strikeforce.

from which Shawn Arévalo McCollough received his Masters of Education ?
Context: ""'Free education"". Many models of free higher education have been proposed. Primary school and other comprehensive or compulsory education is free in many countries, for example, and all education is mostly free (often not including books (from primary) and a number of administrative and sundry fees in university) including post-graduate studies in the Nordic countries. The Article 13 of International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights ensures the right to free education at primary education and progressive introduction of it at secondary and higher education as the right to education. From 2013 in Northern Europe, Estonia started providing free higher education as well. In Argentina, Norway and Finland, no fees apply for foreign students enrolling at a university, although they may not be eligible for a monthly study allowance and loan. Bachelor's degree programmes in Norway are solely taught in Norwegian. Master's degree programmes in Norway are offered in either Norwegian or English depending on the programme or university. Sweden, until the early-21st century, provided free education to foreign students but changes have been introduced to charge fees to foreign students from outside of the European community. Denmark also has universal free education, and provides a monthly stipend, the ""Statens Uddannelsesstøtte"" or ""SU"", to students over 18 years of age or students who are under 18 and attending a higher education. Bachelor and master's degree programmes in Denmark are offered in either Danish or English depending on the programme or university. Czech Republic, Greece, Turkey and Argentina provide free education at all levels, including college and university. <SEP> Education in the British Virgin Islands is largely free and is a requirement for children ages 5 to 17. The British Virgin Islands has a total of 15 public primary schools and 4 secondary public schools. In addition to the public schools, there are 10 primary private schools and 3 secondary private schools. The School year is from September to June. The British Virgin Islands is a part of the British Overseas Territories and therefore the educational system is very similar to the traditional learning system in the United Kingdom. Primary schools are focused on establishing the basics of an academic curriculum and host students between the ages of 5 to 12. After the completion of Primary school, students move on to Secondary school. Secondary school is for students between the ages of 13 and 17. Following the completion of secondary education, students may write their Caribbean secondary education certificate examination. There are approximately 2,700 students who attend primary school for the first 7 years of their required education, however less than 1,800 students successfully finish the following 5 required years of secondary school and complete their certificate exam. Tertiary Education is by no means required in the British Virgin Islands. Students who chose to continue their education after Secondary Education may move on to an additional 2 years of schooling. After 2 years of Tertiary Education is completed, students may take their Caribbean advanced placement examinations. Passing the exams entitles students the right to continue their studies even further at the University of the Virgin Island. This University is the only tertiary education institution in the British Virgin Islands. At the University, students can obtain associate, bachelors, and master's degrees in the departments of business, education, liberal arts and social sciences, or science and mathematic. <SEP> Seventh grade (called Year 8 in the England and Wales, called First Year in Scotland) is a year of education in many nations.

Context: The World Series of Poker (WSOP) is a series of poker tournaments held annually in Las Vegas and, since 2005, sponsored by Caesars Entertainment Corporation (known as Harrah's Entertainment until 2010). It dates its origins to 1970, when Benny Binion invited seven of the best-known poker players to the Horseshoe Casino for a single tournament, with a set start and stop time, and a winner determined by a secret ballot of the seven players. <SEP> Binion's Gambling Hall & Hotel, formerly Binion's Horseshoe, is a casino on the Fremont Street Experience in Downtown Las Vegas, Nevada. It is owned by TLC Casino Enterprises. The casino is named for its founder, Benny Binion, whose family ran it from its founding in 1951 until 2004. The hotel, which had 366 rooms, closed in 2009. <SEP> The Horseshoe Casino Tunica is a casino resort located in Tunica Resorts, Mississippi. It was developed by Jack Binion, the son of Las Vegas gaming legend Benny Binion and named after his father's famous Binion's Horseshoe downtown gambling hall. Much like its namesake, the Horseshoe Tunica is known for catering to serious gamblers, particularly table games players, and is known for its liberal, player-favorable rules and its comp policies. <SEP> The Mouse That Jack Built is a 1959 Warner Bros. ""Merrie Melodie"" cartoon short starring Jack Benny and the regular cast of ""The Jack Benny Program"" as mice. It was written by Tedd Pierce and directed by Robert McKimson, with music by Milt Franklyn. <SEP> U.S.A. Confidential is a 1952 book written by Jack Lait and Lee Mortimer (Crown Publishers). Its theme is crime and corruption. The book is remarkable for early mentions of many who would become infamous, among them Benny Binion and Jimmy Fratianno. <SEP> This is a list of movies featuring comedian Jack Benny. Benny's career lasted from the early 1900s until his death in 1974. In Jack Benny's first film he starred along with Conrad Nagel as master of ceremonies in ""The Hollywood Revue of 1929"", which was a big role for Jack at the time. Benny wouldn't start getting well known until his own radio program in 1934. ""The Hollywood Revue"" is also the oldest known form of Jack Benny in color with the last sequence being filmed originally in color, which was common for a musical in 1929. <SEP> Jack Benny Binion (born February 21, 1937 in Dallas, Texas) is an American businessman. Binion is the son of casino magnate Benny Binion and worked for his father at Binion's Horseshoe, a casino and hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. <SEP> Milt Josefsberg (June 29, 1911 – December 14, 1987) was a radio writer for ""The Jack Benny Program"", and later a writer for many television sitcoms, such as ""Archie Bunker's Place"", ""All in the Family"", ""Here's Lucy"", ""The Lucy Show"", ""The Odd Couple"" and ""The Jack Benny Show"". He wrote books on the Jack Benny Show and comedy writing. Jim Wickey of ""The Green House"", ""The Rip Borsley Show"" once commented about Josefsberg: <SEP> The World Poker Tour bracelet is the World Poker Tour's (WPT) answer to the World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelet. Beginning in 1976, the WSOP started awarding bracelets to winners of WSOP events. The WSOP bracelet has become synonymous with greatness. ""It's impossible to overstate the value of a World Series of Poker gold bracelet to anyone who takes the game seriously,"" stated World Series of Poker Commissioner Jeffrey Pollack during the 2006 bracelet unveiling. ""It is the equivalent of winning the Stanley Cup in hockey or the Lombardi Trophy in football."" Since their introduction, a poker player's success has been measured by the number of bracelets they had won. With introduction of the WPT bracelet, the WPT hopes to capitalize on the prestige of winning poker bracelets. WPT Founder, President and CEO, Steve Lipscomb said, ""The championship bracelet has become synonymous with poker as a symbol of achievement and respect, and we are honored to continue the tradition that Benny Binion [the founder of the WSOP] began over 30 years ago."" <SEP> The Poker Hall of Fame is the hall of fame of professional poker in the United States. Founded in Las Vegas, it was created in 1979 by Benny Binion, the owner of the Horseshoe Casino, to preserve the names and legacies of the world's greatest poker players and to serve as a tourist attraction to his casino. Binion was known for the creative ways in which he marketed his casino. In 1949, he convinced Johnny Moss and Nick ""The Greek"" Dandolos to play high-stakes poker heads up where the public could watch them. In 1970, he invited a group of poker players to compete in what would be the first World Series of Poker (WSOP). When Harrah's Entertainment, now known as Caesars Entertainment, acquired the rights to the WSOP in 2004, it also assumed ownership of the Poker Hall of Fame.

Context: John William Butler (September 14, 1918 – April 1963) was a professional football player in the National Football League drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 1942. He would go on to play for both Steelers merged teams (""Steagles"" in 1943; ""Card-Pitt"" in 1944). In 1943 Butler was drafted into the military due to World War II, however he was physically disqualified for duty. He then made his first start with the ""Steagles"" one day after being ruled 4-F by his draft board for poor eyesight and bad knees. During the 1944 season, Butler was charged, and fined $200, by co-coaches Walt Kiesling and Phil Handler for ""indifferent play"". He was then put on waivers and was soon claimed by the Brooklyn Tigers. In 1945, he played his final season with the Philadelphia Eagles. <SEP> The 2017–18 Chicago Bulls season will be the 52nd season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA). For the first time since 2011, All-Star Jimmy Butler will not be on the roster as he was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in the off-season. <SEP> The National School Scrabble Championship is a Scrabble tournament for 4th-8th graders held annually in North America since 2003. In 2012, 4th graders were allowed to compete for the first time ever. The School Scrabble Championship uses the SSWL dictionary which has offensive words such as ""lez"" or ""jew"" omitted. The competition is tournament Scrabble play, in which teams of two play for 25 minutes with digital timers similar to those used in the board game of chess. The time limit was originally 22 minutes for each side until 2012 when the switch was made to coincide with the traditional times of the Adult Nationals. The team with the most wins is determined the winner. If there are multiple teams with the same number of wins, spread is used to break the tie. Matthew Silver of Connecticut became the first competitor to win two consecutive National School Scrabble Championship titles in 2007 and 2008. He accumulated a 14-0 record in those two years. In 2009, for the first time ever, the event was won by a team of 5th graders, Andy Hoang & Erik Salgado of Salem Elementary in North Carolina. They were the last team to finish the tournament with an undefeated record (7-0). Since then, the champion has finished either 6-1 (2010) or 7-1 (2011, 2012, 2013). The winners have often been invited to be on Good Morning America and Jimmy Kimmel Live!. The event has also received recognition from president Barack Obama and NBA superstar Shaquille O'Neal, who are advocates for the game themselves. In 2012, Andy Hoang & Erik Salgado of North Carolina became the first team to win two NSSC titles, their first as 5th graders in 2009, and their second as 8th graders in 2012. The 2013 NSSC was held in Washington D.C. 2013 marked the first time since 2009 that a previous champion will not be competing. In 2010, 2011, and 2012, Andy Hoang, Erik Salgado, Bradley Robbins, and Evan McCarthy were champions that returned. Only Andy Hoang and Erik Salgado were the only ones to repeat during the streak. With Kevin Bowerman and Raymond Gao's win in 2013, North Carolina became the first state to hold 3 National titles (Winning 3 of the last 5 tournaments: 2009, 2012, & 2013), the most of all the states or districts in North America. <SEP> Jimmy Butler (February 20, 1921 in Akron, Ohio – February 18, 1945 in France) was an American, juvenile, motion-pictures actor, active in the 1930s and early 1940s. <SEP> When a Man's a Man is a 1935 American Western film directed by Edward F. Cline and written by Frank Mitchell Dazey and Agnes Christine Johnston. The film stars George O'Brien, Dorothy Wilson, Paul Kelly, Harry Woods, Jimmy Butler and Richard Carlyle. The film was released on February 15, 1935, by Fox Film Corporation. <SEP> Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has been home to many teams and events in professional, semi-professional, amateur, college, and high-school sports. Philadelphia is one of twelve cities that hosts teams in all four major sports leagues in North America, and Philadelphia is one of just three cities in which one team from every league plays within city limits. These major sports teams are the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball, the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League, the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association and the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League. Each team has played in Philadelphia since at least the 1960s, and each team has won at least one championship. Since 2010, Philadelphia has been the home of the Philadelphia Union of Major League Soccer which plays in suburban Chester, Pennsylvania, making the Philadelphia market one of nine cities that hosts a team in the four major sports leagues and the MLS. Philadelphia hosts several college sports teams, including the Philadelphia Big 5 schools and Temple's Division I FBS football team. Many of these teams have fan bases in both Philadelphia and the surrounding Delaware Valley. In addition to the major professional and college sports, numerous semi-pro, amateur, community, and high school teams play in Philadelphia. The city hosts numerous sporting events, such as the Penn Relays and the Collegiate Rugby Championship, and Philadelphia has been the most frequent host of the annual Army-Navy football game. Philadelphia has also been the home of several renowned athletes and sports figures. Philly furthermore has played a historically significant role in the development of cricket and extreme wrestling in the United States. <SEP> The shooting guard (SG), also known as the two or off guard, is one of the five positions in a regulation basketball game. A shooting guard's main objective is to score points for his team. Some teams ask their shooting guards to bring up the ball as well; these players are known colloquially as combo guards. Kobe Bryant, for example, as a shooting guard was as good a playmaker as he was a scorer; other examples of combo guards are Dwyane Wade, Allen Iverson, James Harden, Manu Ginóbili, Jamal Crawford, Randy Foye and Jason Terry. A player who can switch between playing shooting guard and small forward is known as a swingman. Notable swing men (also known as wing players) include Jimmy Butler, Tracy McGrady, Vince Carter, Joe Johnson, Andre Iguodala, Andrew Wiggins, Evan Turner and Tyreke Evans. In the NBA, shooting guards usually range from 6' 4"" (1.93 m) to 6' 7"" (2.01 m) and 5' 9"" (1.75 m) to 6' 0"" (1.83 m) in the WNBA. <SEP> Lauri Markkanen (born May 22, 1997) is a Finnish basketball player for the Chicago Bulls of the National Basketball Association (NBA). In the 2017 NBA draft, he was taken by the Minnesota Timberwolves with the 7th overall pick before being included in a trade to the Chicago Bulls for Jimmy Butler. He is the son of Finnish basketball players Pekka and Riikka Markkanen and brothers with the football player Eero Markkanen who plays in the German second-tier side Dynamo Dresden. <SEP> In American football, each team has 11 players on the field at one time. The specific role that a player takes on the field is called his position. Under the modern rules of American football, teams are allowed unlimited substitutions; that is, teams may change any number of players after any play. This has resulted in the development of three ""platoons"" of players: the offense (the team with the ball, which is trying to score), the defense (the team trying to prevent the other team from scoring, and to take the ball from them), and the special teams (who play in kicking situations). Within those platoons, various specific positions exist depending on what each player's main job is. <SEP> Jimmy Butler III (born September 14, 1989) is an American professional basketball player for the Minnesota Timberwolves of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Born in Houston, Butler grew up in Tomball, Texas, and played college basketball for Tyler Junior College and Marquette University. He was drafted with the 30th overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls. He is a three-time NBA All-Star and a three-time NBA All-Defensive Team honoree, and was named to his first All-NBA Team in 2017. In 2015, he was named the NBA Most Improved Player."

Context: Fort Edward Johnson was a series of Confederate States of America (CSA) military breastworks constructed in April 1862 by the four-thousand member brigade known as the ""Army of the Northwest"". The Army of the Northwest was a remnant of the Confederate Army of the Northwest which had been disbanded in February 1862. The Army of the Northwest was commanded by Colonel Edward ""Alleghany"" Johnson and had been ordered to secure a major roadway through the Appalachian Mountains known as the Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike. Johnson ordered the construction of fortifications and breastworks at a high point along the turnpike on top of Shenandoah Mountain, which is in the U.S. state of Virginia, 26 mi west of Staunton. <SEP> Goose Hollow is a neighborhood in southwest Portland, Oregon, United States. It acquired its distinctive name through early residents' practice of letting their geese run free in Tanner Creek Gulch and near the wooded ravine in the Tualatin Mountains known as the Tanner Creek Canyon. Tanner Creek Gulch was a 20-block-long, 50 ft gulch (or hollow) that started around SW 17th and Jefferson and carried the waters of Tanner Creek into Couch Lake (now the site of Old Town/Chinatown and the Pearl District). Over a century ago, Tanner Creek was buried 50 ft underground (where it still drains the West Hills), and the Tanner Creek Gulch was infilled. Thus, the only remaining part of the hollow is the ravine (Tanner Creek Canyon) carved out by Tanner Creek through which Highway 26 passes and which the Vista Bridge spans (also called the Vista Viaduct). <SEP> Grutas de Bustamante (Bustamante Caves), also known as Palmito Caves, are a group of natural caves located in the municipality of Bustamante, Nuevo Leon. The caves are located in an entrance of the mountains known as Sierra de Gomas, the Bustamente caves are located 107 kilometers northwest outside Monterrey and 7 kilometers southwest Bustamante municipal seat. <SEP> The Radstadt Tauern (German: ""Radstädter Tauern"" ) are a subrange of the Central Eastern Alps in Austria. Together with the Schladming Tauern, the Rottenmann and Wölz Tauern and the Seckau Tauern the Radstadt Tauern form the major range of mountains known as the Low Tauern. The mountains are found in the southeast of the Austrian state of Salzburg, between the upper reaches of the Enns and Mur rivers. <SEP> Lemkos (Ukrainian: ""Лeмки"" , Polish: ""Łemkowie"" , Lemko: ""Лeмкы"", translit. ""Lemkŷ""; sing. ""Лeмкo"", ""Lemko"") are an ethnic sub-group inhabiting a stretch of the Carpathian Mountains known as Lemkivshchyna. Many Lemkos are classified as a branch of Ukrainians by the Ukrainian government. Ukraine has signed but not honored the CSCE/OSCE Copenhagen Document of 1990, Article IV particularly, granting self-identified Lemkos minority rights status in Ukraine. Slovakia identifies them as a sub-group of Rusyns (Ruthenians), an East Slavic minority distinct from Ukrainians. Rusyns themselves have been abandoning Ukrainian nationality, enforced during Communism, in favor of a Rusyn identity, which can be observed in the minority statistics of Slovakia. <SEP> The Georgia Mountains Region or North Georgia mountains or Northeast Georgia is an area that starts in the northeast corner of Georgia, United States, and spreads in a westerly direction. The mountains in this region are in the Blue Ridge mountain chain that ends in Georgia. At over 1 billion years of age, the Blue Ridge mountains are among the oldest mountains in the United States and sometimes mistaken to be the oldest mountains in the world (they are only about one third of the age of South Africa's 3.6 billion year old Barberton greenstone belt.). The mountains in this region are also a part of the vast system of North American mountains known as the Appalachian Mountains that spans most of the United States longitudally along the eastern areas of the nation and terminates in Alabama. <SEP> The climate of Central Asia became dry after the large tectonic collision between the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. This impact threw up the massive chain of mountains known as the Himalayas. The Himalayas, Greater Khingan and Lesser Khingan mountains act like a high wall, blocking the warm and wet climate from penetrating into Central Asia. Many of the mountains of Mongolia were formed during the Late Neogene and Early Quaternary periods. The Mongolian climate was more humid hundreds of thousands of years ago. <SEP> The Bulusan Volcano Natural Park is a 3673 ha protected area of rainforest surrounding Mount Bulusan in the Philippines. It was first designated as a National Park by Proclamation no. 811 on June 7, 1935.

Context: Living Eyes was the second studio album released by Sydney, Australia punk-rock band Radio Birdman.

The album was recorded over a three-week period at the Rockfield Studios in Wales whilst the band was on its first overseas tour, supporting the Flamin' Groovies around Britain and Europe. The original master tapes disappeared before the album was released and as a result the album was mastered from a cassette recording of trial mixes, which impacted on the sound quality. ""Living Eyes"" sound was heavily influenced by the lead guitarist and producer Deniz Tek who had lived in Detroit before moving to Australia and been influenced musically by the ""Motor City Rock"" sound. The music of Birdman has been compared to that of The Stooges and MC5, but their sound is also comparable to that of 60's rock 'n' roll bands such as The Rolling Stones. <SEP> ""Free Language Demons / Up On the Roof"" is a split EP between Kansas City, Missouri emo band The Get Up Kids and the San Diego, California punk outfit Rocket From the Crypt.

Here is a list of just a few of the species that have invaded South America and where they originate. <SEP> Universal life insurance (often shortened to UL) is a type of cash value life insurance, sold primarily in the United States of America. Under the terms of the policy, the excess of premium payments above the current cost of insurance is credited to the cash value of the policy. The cash value is credited each month with interest, and the policy is debited each month by a cost of insurance (COI) charge, as well as any other policy charges and fees drawn from the cash value, even if no premium payment is made that month. Interest credited to the account is determined by the insurer, but has a contractual minimum rate (often 2%). When an earnings rate is pegged to a financial index such as a stock, bond or other interest rate index, the policy is an ""Indexed Universal Life"" contract. These types of policies offer the advantage of guaranteed level premiums throughout the insured's lifetime at substantially lower premium cost than an equivalent whole life policy at first; the cost of insurance is always increasing as found on the cost index table (usually p. 3 of a contract). This not only allows for easy comparison of costs between carriers, but also works well in irrevocable life insurance trusts (ILIT's) since cash is of no consequence. <SEP> Shareholder value is a business term, sometimes phrased as shareholder value maximization or as the shareholder value model, which implies that the ultimate measure of a company's success is the extent to which it enriches shareholders. It became popular during the 1980s, and is particularly associated with former CEO of General Electric, Jack Welch. <SEP> A chief executive officer (CEO) is the position of the most senior corporate officer, executive, leader or administrator in charge of managing an organization. CEOs lead a range of organizations, including public and private corporations, non-profit organizations and even some government organizations (e.g., Crown corporations). The CEO of a corporation or company typically reports to the board of directors and is charged with maximizing the value of the entity, which may include maximizing the share price, market share, revenues, or another element. In the non-profit and government sector, CEOs typically aim at achieving outcomes related to the organization's mission, such as reducing poverty, increasing literacy, etc. Titles also often given to the holder of CEO position include president, chief executive (CE), and managing director (MD), as well as representative director (RD) in Japan. <SEP> The Journal of Creating Value is a peer reviewed academic journal that focusses on creating value for customers and in turn creating value for the company and its stakeholders. Gautam Mahajan, CEO Customer Value Foundation is the founding editor of the Journal."

The museum is located on the second floor of the Old Lake Worth City Hall at 414 Lake Avenue and is currently open on Wednesday and Friday from 1:00-4:00p.m. <SEP> A caisson lock was invented in the late 18th century as a solution to minimise the use of great volumes of water required to raise and lower canal boats through large height differences. It was normal to only raise and lower boats through small height differences of a few feet when traversing undulating terrain. A solution was required when either large height differences were encountered or water was in short supply. The Caisson (or Caisoon) was thought to be one solution. The technology of the time was not capable of achieving this type of construction economically with current building materials. This design attempted was a type of canal lock in which a narrowboat is floated into a sealed watertight box and raised or lowered between two different canal water levels. It was designed primarily as a water-saving measure, and also was an attempt to minimise construction costs compared with other engineering solutions of the time. In use it was capable of replacing up to seven conventional locks. Other design benefits were speed of boat descent/ascent, and only a little loss of water when operating compared with a conventional boat lock. <SEP> The Palm Beach Inlet, also known as the Lake Worth Inlet is an artificial cut through a barrier island connecting the northern part of the Lake Worth Lagoon in Palm Beach County, Florida with the Atlantic Ocean.

Context: Bennington was one of the camping places for Indians that came through the Bear Lake valley each year on their hunting and fishing trips. They camped there until the 1930s, asking for food from the residents. An emigrant massacre happened at the mouth of four Mile Canyon. The emigrants head camp of the main road for better feed and plentiful water. A band of Shoshone led by ""Paughatello"" killed all the members of the company except for one 15-year-old boy, who hid in a wash and made his way back to another company. He went on to Oregon or California with the team. The battle spanned over 40 acres along the creek. Seven wagons, 20 people, 33 horses and 14 head of livestock were involved. Wagon parts, bones, cap and ball pistols, swords and other relics could be found decades later. The first town site of Bennington was located on block West on highway 30 at the Cemetery and Wright Roads, where the old Amos Wright log cabin still stands. The first settlers, Jared Bullock, and Jonathan Hoopes, came in the fall of 1864 and settled on the south side of Bennington Creek. Then Evan M. Greene, Hyrum Hoopes and Edmond Homer came. Six families spent the winter in 1864.In 1865 and 1866 more people were called to settle . In 1866 the community was officially named after a town in Vermont where Brigham Young once lived. In 1873 the town had a meeting, and the present town site was chosen. A church, school, store/post office and new homes were eventually built. Evan Green was the first Presiding Elder serving from 1864 to 1865, followed by Dudley Merrell, who presided until 1870, then Alonzo became the first Bishop. Church was held in a vacant house until one could be built. The first living white baby born Feb. 18, 1866 was Winnifred Rebecca Wright daughter of Amos R. Wright. The first death was Admanza Greene who died of pneumonia at age 10. Jared Bullock's wife died of childbirth. She was buried at the end of the haystack and then moved to the present cemetery later. Deep snow, cold weather and primitive living conditions made living here hard. A traveling band and a dancing academy taught by John Dunn was organized to help people get through the long winter mounts. In 1934 there was a terrible drought. At that time each home and building at the new town site had their own well. They all dried up except the one at the school so people carried water from there. The WPA helped with a new water system and during 1934-35 the men of the community dug ditches and laid the pipe to their homes. They had a big celebration at its completion in August 1936. Today Bennington is a thriving town with many new homes and a big church. <SEP> The Complexo do Alemão massacre (] ) was the result of an ongoing conflict between drug dealers and the police in the borough of the same name in Rio de Janeiro, which consisted of a group of large ""favelas"" in the northern region of the city. The massacre happened on June 27, 2007, when a large Military and Civil Police operation killed 19 people and injured several others. The Order of Attorneys of Brazil issued a report claiming that at least eleven of the people killed had no relations with drug trafficking whatsoever. Until the end of the XV Pan-American Games a large siege was formed by the police in the region—to secure the safety of the international event, some people claim. While it eventually got attached the demotic sobriquet ""Gaza strip"", a report published by the federal government revealed that there were executions at the operation. <SEP> The Bodo League massacre (Hangul: 보도연맹 학살사건 ; Hanja: 保導聯盟虐殺事件 ) was a massacre and war crime against communists and suspected sympathizers (many of whom were civilians who had no connection with communism or communists) that occurred in the summer of 1950 during the Korean War.

The massacre was wrongly blamed on the communists. For four decades the South Korean government concealed this massacre.

The massacre happened on June 12, 1991, in which 152 civilians were killed. The Sri Lankan government instituted presidential commission to investigate the massacre. The commission found the commanding officer negligent in controlling his troops and recommended that he be removed from office. The commission also identified 19 members of the Sri Lankan military as responsible for mass murder. In a military tribunal that followed the presidential commission in the capital city of Colombo, all the 19 charged soldiers were later acquitted. <SEP> The Ganghwa massacre (Korean: 강화 양민학살 사건 , Hanja: 江華良民虐殺事件) was a massacre conducted by the South Korean forces, South Korean Police forces and pro-South Korean militiamen, between 6 and 9 January 1951, of 212 to 1,300 unarmed civilians in the Ganghwa county of the Incheon metropolitan city in South Korea. The victims were collaborators with the Korean People's Army during North Korean rule. Before this massacre, 140 people were executed in Ganghwa in what is known as the Bodo League massacre in 1950. <SEP> The Vukovar massacre, also known as the Vukovar hospital massacre or the Ovčara massacre, was the killing of Croatian prisoners of war and civilians by Serb paramilitaries and the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) at the Ovčara farm southeast of Vukovar on 20 November 1991, during the Croatian War of Independence. The massacre occurred shortly after Vukovar's capture by the JNA, Croatian Serb Territorial Defence (TO), and paramilitaries from neighbouring Serbia. It was the largest massacre of the war and the worst war crime in Europe since World War II up until that point."

and differentiating between, masculinity and femininity which Mary Karooro Okurut was appointed to in 2012 as Minister of?
Context: A gender role is a set of societal norms dictating the types of behaviors which are generally considered acceptable, appropriate, or desirable for people based on their actual or perceived sex or sexuality. Gender roles are usually centered on conceptions of femininity and masculinity, although there are exceptions and variations. The specifics regarding these gendered expectations may vary substantially among cultures, while other characteristics may be common throughout a range of cultures. There is ongoing debate as to what extent gender roles and their variations are biologically determined, and to what extent they are socially constructed. <SEP> Beech (""Fagus"") is a genus of deciduous trees in the family Fagaceae, native to temperate Europe, Asia and North America. Recent classification systems of the genus recognize ten to thirteen species in two distinct subgenera, ""Engleriana"" and ""Fagus"". The ""Engleriana"" subgenus is found only in East Asia, and is notably distinct from the ""Fagus"" subgenus in that these beeches are low-branching trees, often made up of several major trunks with yellowish bark. Further differentiating characteristics include the whitish bloom on the underside of the leaves, the visible tertiary leaf veins, and a long, smooth cupule-peduncle. ""Fagus japonica"", ""Fagus engleriana"", and the species ""F. okamotoi"", proposed by the botanist Chung-Fu Shen in 1992, comprise this subgenus. The better known ""Fagus"" subgenus beeches are high-branching with tall, stout trunks and smooth silver-grey bark. This group includes ""Fagus sylvatica"", ""Fagus grandifolia"", ""Fagus crenata"", ""Fagus lucida"", ""Fagus longipetiolata"", and ""Fagus hayatae"". The classification of the European beech, ""Fagus sylvatica"" is complex, with a variety of different names proposed for different species and subspecies within this region (for example ""Fagus taurica"", ""Fagus orientalis"", and ""Fagus moesica""). Research suggests that beeches in Eurasia differentiated fairly late in evolutionary history, during the Miocene. The populations in this area represent a range of often overlapping morphotypes, though genetic analysis does not clearly support separate species. <SEP> Gendered racism is a form of oppression that occurs due to race and gender. It is perpetuated due to the prevalence of perceptions, stereotypes, and images of certain groups. Racism is defined as the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race. Racism functions as a way to distinguish races as inferior or superior to one another. Sexism is defined as prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination on the basis of sex. Gendered racism differs in that it pertains specifically to racial and ethnic understandings of masculinity and femininity, as well as along gendered forms of race and ethnic discrimination. <SEP> Chanel J12 is a watch range made by Chanel that was launched in 1999.

The locality is known for its fishing and for occasional whale sightings in the winter. <SEP> Blyth Power Station (also known as Cambois Power Station) refers to a pair of now demolished coal-fired power stations, which were located on the Northumberland coast in North East England. The two stations were built alongside each other on a site near Cambois in Northumberland, on the northern bank of the River Blyth, between its tidal estuary and the North Sea. The stations took their name from the town of Blyth on the opposite bank of the estuary. Blyth A Power Station was built and opened first but had a smaller generating capacity than its sister station, Blyth B Power Station, which was built to its west four years later. The power stations' four large chimneys were a landmark of the Northumberland skyline for over 40 years; the A Station's two chimneys each stood at 140 m ; the B Station's two chimneys were taller, at 170 m each. <SEP> Dunston Power Station refers to a pair of adjacent coal-fired power stations in the North East of England, now demolished.

It comprises two individual power stations, built in two stages in the form of a single building. Battersea A Power Station was built in the 1930s, with Battersea B Power Station to the east in the 1950s. The two stations were built to a nearly identical design, providing the long-recognized four-chimney layout. The station ceased generating electricity in 1983, but over the past 50 years it has become one of the best known landmarks in London and is Grade II* listed. The station's celebrity owes much to numerous popular culture references, which include the cover art of Pink Floyd's 1977 album ""Animals"" and its appearance in the 1965 Beatles' film ""Help!"" <SEP> Playford B Power Station was located at Port Paterson in the Australian state of South Australia about 5.5 km south of the city centre of Port Augusta. It was coal powered with four 60 MW steam turbines that generate a total of 240 MW of electricity. Playford B received coal by rail from the Leigh Creek Coal Mine, 280 km to the north and draws cooling water from Spencer Gulf, returning it to the sea at an elevated temperature. Commissioned in 1963, it was co-located with the larger, newer Northern Power Station. Playford B was mothballed in 2012 and its permanent closure was announced by operator Alinta Energy in October 2015. Prior to being mothballed it primarily operated in the summer, when electricity demand peaks. <SEP> Playford A power station was the first power station built by the Electricity Trust of South Australia at Port Paterson, South Australia near Port Augusta in South Australia. It was built in the early 1950s to generate electricity from coal mined from the Telford Cut at Leigh Creek and transported 250 km by rail. It was joined by the Playford B Power Station soon after, and the Northern Power Station in 1980. <SEP> The Rugeley power stations were a series of two coal-fired power stations located on the River Trent at Rugeley in Staffordshire. The first power station on the site, Rugeley A power station was opened in 1961, but has since been closed and demolished. Rugeley B power station was commissioned in 1970 and closed on 8 June 2016. It had an output of 1,000 megawatts (MW) and had a 400 kilovolt (kV) connection to the national grid. The B station provided enough electricity to power roughly half a million homes."

The frizzle type is not a separate breed, but a variety within breeds. Though all breeds of chickens may be frizzled; it is most commonly seen in breeds such as the Cochin, Pekin, and Polish. Chickens with this pattern are sometimes referred to as frizzles. The gene which causes the frizzles' peculiar feathering is a dominant trait. As a result of its unusual look, frizzles are primarily used as exhibition birds, and are included in most English language poultry standards. <SEP> Griffon is a type of dog - a collection of breeds that were originally hunting dogs. There are three lines of the griffon type recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI): the griffon vendéens, the wirehaired pointers, and the ""smousje"" (Belgian companion dogs or Dutch Smoushond). The griffon type is characterized by rough or wire-hair. <SEP> Griffon is a collection of dog breeds that were originally hunting dogs. <SEP> Rare breed (dog) is any breed of dog that is small in number and is used to refer to both old established breeds such as the Stabyhoun and Glen of Imaal Terrier or newer creations. Since dogs have greater genetic variability than other domesticated animals the number of possible breeds is vast with new crosses constantly occurring, from these both selected and random crosses may come new breeds should offspring reliably breed true to type. New breeds from the wild such as the Carolina Dog are quite rare compared to attempts at breed creation from man as found in the American Hairless Terrier which sought to exploit a mutation. <SEP> The Griffon Bruxellois or Brussels Griffon is a breed of toy dog, named for their city of origin: Brussels, Belgium. The Griffon Bruxellois may refer to three different breeds, the Griffon Bruxellois, the Griffon Belge and the Petit Brabançon. Identical in standard except for coat and colour differences, in some standards they are considered varieties of the same breed, much like Belgian Shepherd Dogs. <SEP> Feathering or feather is the long hair on the lower legs and fetlocks of some breeds of horse and pony. On some horses, especially draft breeds, the hair can almost cover the hooves. While nearly all horses will grow longer hair on the lower legs and back of the fetlocks at times, particularly in the winter, ""feather"" refers to the particularly long, luxuriant growth that is characteristic of certain breeds. <SEP> Chiari-like malformation (CM) is the most common cause of foramen magnum obstruction and syringomyelia in dogs. Syringomyelia (SM) is a disease of the spinal cord typified by fluid filled cavities, or syrinxes, within the spinal cord substance. The disease is caused by the obstruction of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in the nervous system. A situation of high pressure in the spinal cord compared to low pressure outside, leads to fluid accumulation, which eventually forms cavities. CM is a condition characterized by the mismatch of size between the brain and the skull. The skull is too small causing part of the brain to descend out of the skull through the opening at its base, crowding the spinal cord. The cause of CM is not yet fully understood. CM is rare in most breeds but reportedly has become very widespread in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and the Griffon Bruxellois (Brussels Griffon). Some researchers estimate that as many as 95% of CKCSs may have CM. It is worldwide in scope and not limited to any country, breeding line, or kennel, and experts report that it is believed to be inherited in the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. CM is so widespread in the Cavalier that it may be an inherent part of the CKCS's breed standard. This disease not only affects thousands of dogs, but a similar condition affects over three hundred thousand children yearly. Therefore, canines are an appropriate model for the treatment of the human condition. <SEP> Finncattle refers to three closely related cattle breeds of Finnish origin. Finncattle is most often kept for dairy production, and some animals are found in petting zoos and as pets. The Finncattle breeds are of small size and naturally polled, however they differ in appearance and production levels. The Western Finncattle is red, and the largest of the three breeds. The North Finnish cattle variety are white, the West Finnish are red, while the East Finnish are both white and red. <SEP> The Stabyhoun or Stabij is one of the top five rarest dog breeds in the world. It is from Friesland and in particular from the Frisian forest area, a region in the southeast and east of Friesland. The breed has been mentioned in Dutch literature going back to the early 1800s, but has only extended its range from the 1960s outside of Friesland and not until the 2000s did the range officially extend beyond the Netherlands. The name Stabij translates roughly as ""stand by me"" with the last part simply Frisian, meaning dog, which is pronounced ""hoon"". The dog is considered a Dutch national treasure.

Airplant is a common name for plants in this genus. Most ""Tillandsia"" species are epiphytes – i.e. they normally grow without soil while attached to other plants. Some are aerophytes or ""air plants"", which have no roots and grow on shifting desert soil. Generally, the thinner-leafed varieties grow in rainy areas and the thick-leafed varieties in areas more subject to drought. Most species absorb moisture and nutrients through the leaves from rain, dew, dust, decaying leaves and insect matter, aided by structures called trichomes. <SEP> The name zebrawood is used to describe several tree species and the wood derived from them. Zebrawood is characterized by a striped figure that is reminiscent of a zebra. The name originally applied to the wood of ""Astronium graveolens"", a large tree native to Central America.

The documents ""Realtime Procedural Terrain Generation"", ""Procedural City Modeling"", ""Procedural Landscapes with Overhangs"", ""Towards multiobjective procedural map generation"", and ""Grouping dominant orientations for ill-structured road following"" bring useful information to the query ""Declarative Terrain Modeling for Military Training Games"" as they all relate to procedural terrain modeling, which is a common technique used in creating terrain for military training games. The document ""Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks"" also brings useful information as it mentions generative models, which can be used in terrain modeling. All other documents do not bring useful information to the query.","<ANSWER>

Explanation:

The documents 'Metacognitive awareness of learning strategies in undergraduates' and 'Learning answer embeddings for Visual Question Answering' bring useful information to the query as they directly discuss metacognitive strategies and student learning, including retrieval practices. The document 'Neural activations associated with feedback and retrieval success' also brings useful information as it relates to the neural processes involved in retrieval, which is a key aspect of metacognitive strategies. All other documents do not bring useful information to the query as they do not directly discuss metacognitive strategies or student retrieval practices."

Explanation:

The query is about ""Permutation invariant training of deep models for speaker-independent multi-talker speech separation"".

The documents that bring useful information to the query are:
1. ""Multitalker Speech Separation With Utterance-Level Permutation Invariant Training of Deep Recurrent Neural Networks""
2. ""Monaural Audio Speaker Separation with Source Contrastive Estimation""
3. ""Multi-Stage Variational Auto-Encoders for Coarse-to-Fine Image Generation"" (This document mentions permutation invariant training in the context of image generation, but the concept can be applied to speech separation as well)

The documents that do not bring useful information to the query are:
0. ""Single-channel multi-talker speech recognition with permutation invariant training"" (This document is about speech recognition, not separation)
1. ""Role of mask pattern in intelligibility of ideal binary-masked noisy speech.""

</ANSWER>

The documents ""Finding Bernie Madoff : Detecting Fraud by Investment Managers"", ""Using Nonfinancial Measures to Assess Fraud Risk"", ""Financial Fraud Detection"", ""Insurer vs . Insurance Fraud : Characteristics and Detection"", and ""A survey on classification techniques for opinion mining and sentiment analysis"" bring useful information to the query ""The Fraud Diamond : Considering the Four Elements of Fraud"" as they discuss various aspects of fraud detection and prevention. All other documents do not bring useful information to the query as they are not directly related to fraud or fraud detection.","<ANSWER>

The documents ""The GeneMANIA prediction server: biological network integration for gene prioritization and predicting gene function"" and ""Transfer Learning for Melanoma Detection: Participation in ISIC 2017 Skin Lesion Classification Challenge"" bring useful information to the query ""Network Sketching: Exploiting Binary Structure in Deep CNNs"" as they both involve the use of deep learning techniques in their respective fields.","<ANSWER>
1 (for ""A holistic view on hyper-dense heterogeneous and small cell networks"" and ""Learning Knowledge-guided Pose Grammar Machine for 3D Human Pose Estimation"")
0 (for all other documents)
</ANSWER>

Explanation: The query is about ""Network Sketching: Exploiting Binary Structure in Deep CNNs"". The documents ""A holistic view on hyper-dense heterogeneous and small cell networks"" and ""Learning Knowledge-guided Pose Grammar Machine for 3D Human Pose Estimation"" contain information related to networks, which is a common term in both the query and these documents. However, they do not specifically mention ""Network Sketching: Exploiting Binary Structure in Deep CNNs"". Therefore, we mark them as 1 since they bring some level of relevance to the query. All other documents do not bring any useful information to the query as they do not mention ""Network Sketching: Exploiting Binary Structure in Deep CNNs""."

[0 if ""Object Detection"" not in doc and (""Multi-region"" not in doc or ""Semantic Segmentation"" not in doc or ""CNN Model"" not in doc) for doc in documents]
[1 if ""Object Detection"" in doc and (""Multi-region"" in doc or ""Semantic Segmentation"" in doc or ""CNN Model"" in doc) for doc in documents]
</ANSWER>

Here's the step-by-step Python code:

```python
documents = ['A MultiPath Network for Object Detection', 'Detecting Small Signs from Large Images', 'Perceptual Generative Adversarial Networks for Small Object Detection', 'Feature-Fused SSD: Fast Detection for Small Objects', 'Context-Aware Single-Shot Detector', 'Unsupervised Learning of Neural Networks to Explain Neural Networks (extended abstract)', 'Modelling of Metal Oxide Surge Arresters in Simulation Software DYNAST', 'CIRL: Controllable Imitative Reinforcement Learning for Vision-Based Self-driving', 'Deduplication on Encrypted Big Data in Cloud', 'Assessment of eating disorders: interview or self-report questionnaire?', 'The Indian Buffet Process: An Introduction and Review', 'Contextual boost for pedestrian detection', 'Ranking Relevance in Yahoo Search', 'Collective Event Detection via a Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms', 'Auxiliary Multimodal LSTM for Audio-visual Speech Recognition and Lipreading', 'Does Capital Punishment Deter Murder ?', 'Data Storage Security and Privacy in Cloud Computing : A Comprehensive Survey', 'Mitigating Crossfire Attacks Using SDN-Based Moving Target Defense', 'Case-control studies: research in reverse', 'Big Data– BigData 2018', 'Website characteristics , Trust and purchase intention in online stores :-An Empirical study in the Indian context', 'Adversarial Removal of Demographic Attributes from Text Data', 'Principles of Robot Motion: Theory, Algorithms, and Implementations [Book Review]', 'Design of a quasi-passive knee exoskeleton to assist running', 'Big IoT Data Analytics: Architecture, Opportunities, and Open Research Challenges', 'Developing standards for reporting implementation studies of complex interventions (StaRI): a systematic review and e-Delphi', 'A Highly Parallel Framework for HEVC Coding Unit Partitioning Tree Decision on Many-core Processors', 'Addressing Noise in Multidialectal Word Embeddings', 'Color and texture descriptors', 'Learning Latent Vector Spaces for Product Search']

query = ""Object Detection via a Multi-region and Semantic Segmentation-Aware CNN Model""

useful_docs = [0] * len(documents)

for i, doc in enumerate(documents):
    if ""Object Detection"" in doc:
        if (""Multi-region"" in doc or ""Semantic Segmentation"" in doc or ""CNN Model"" in doc):
            useful_docs[i] = 1

print(useful_docs)
</ANSWER>
```

This code initializes a list `useful_docs` of length equal to the number of documents with all elements set to 0. It then iterates through each document and sets the corresponding element in `useful_docs` to 1 if the document contains the query terms ""Object Detection"", ""Multi-region"", ""Semantic Segmentation"", and ""CNN Model"". Finally, it prints the resulting list.","<ANSWER>

Explanation:

The query is about ""Social engineering attack framework"". The documents that bring useful information to the query are those that discuss social engineering attacks, phishing attacks (which are a type of social engineering attack), detection of social engineering attacks, and frameworks or theories related to social engineering attacks. The documents that do not bring useful information to the query are those that do not mention social engineering attacks, phishing attacks, or frameworks related to these attacks.

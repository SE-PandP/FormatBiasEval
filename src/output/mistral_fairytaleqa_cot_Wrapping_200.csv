Explanation:
The text states that the poor neighbor could not hire a single man to help him cut the hay for his cow. This meant that he would have to do the work himself, which was a daunting task given the amount of hay that needed to be cut. Additionally, the rich neighbor had amassed a large number of mowers, making the poor neighbor's situation even more frustrating.

Question: why didn't maie have a junket or a can of fresh milk ?","Maie didn't have a junket or a can of fresh milk because they didn't have a cow. <ANSWER>

In the text, Maie expresses her longing for buttermilk, sweet cream, and fresh butter. She laments the fact that the buttermilk in her coffee doesn't taste as good as it used to. When some students come to their shore asking for junket (a type of curdled milk) or a can of fresh milk, Maie is unable to provide them with what they ask for. Her husband, Matte, offers them smoked herring instead. When one of the students asks about a small stone in the middle of the ocean, Maie's husband identifies it as Ahtola, implying that they live in the sea king's dominion. However, despite their apparent wealth in other resources, they do not have a cow to produce fresh milk. <ANSWER>",,"Maie did not have a junket or a can of fresh milk because she and her husband did not own a cow.

Explanation:
In the text, Maie expresses her longing for buttermilk, sweet cream, and fresh butter. She laments the fact that her husband is right, but she cannot give up her desire for these dairy products.

However, her husband Matte informs the students that they have no cow and can only offer smoked herring. When one of the students asks about a small stone in the ocean, Matte identifies it as Ahtola, implying that they live in the sea king's dominion. Therefore, it can be inferred that the lack of a cow is the reason why Maie and her husband cannot provide junket or fresh milk to the students.",,Maie did not have a junket or a can of fresh milk because they did not own a cow. *The lack of a cow prevented them from producing the fresh milk necessary for these dairy products.,,"Maie did not have a junket or a can of fresh milk because they did not have a cow.

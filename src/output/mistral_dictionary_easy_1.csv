2. Label Ambiguity

However, I can give you an example of how you might extract task entities from your document using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and libraries like spaCy or NLTK.

Here's an example using spaCy:

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load(""en_core_web_sm"")

document = nlp(""Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision"")

task_entities = []

for ent in document.ents:
    if ent.label_ == ""TASK"":
        task_entities.append(ent.text)

output = {'task': task_entities}

print(output)
```

In this example, we first load the English language model from spaCy. We then process the input document using the `nlp` function, which returns a `Doc` object. We iterate through the named entities in the document and check if their label is ""TASK"". If so, we add the text of the entity to our list of task entities. Finally, we create a dictionary with the key ""task"" and the value being our list of task entities, and print the output.

Note that in order for this code to work, you need to have spaCy installed and the English language model downloaded. You can install spaCy using pip:

```bash
pip install spacy
```

And download the English language model using the following command:

However, I can give you an example of how you might extract task entities from a given document using Python and a Natural Language Processing (NLP) library like spaCy or NLTK.

Here's an example using spaCy:

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load(""en_core_web_sm"")

document = [""Your document text goes here""]
doc = nlp("" "".join(document))

task_entities = []

for ent in doc.ents:
    if ent.label_ == ""TASK"":
        task_entities.append(ent.text)

output = {'task': task_entities}
print(output)
```

In this example, we first load the English language model from spaCy. We then process the document text by joining all the words into a single string and passing it to the `nlp` function. We then iterate through all the named entities in the document and check if their label is ""TASK"". If so, we add the text of the entity to our list of task entities. Finally, we create a Python dictionary with the key ""task"" and the value being our list of task entities, and print the output.

Note that in order for this code to work, you need to have spaCy installed and the English language model downloaded. You can install spaCy using pip:

```bash
pip install spacy
```

And you can download the English language model using the following command:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

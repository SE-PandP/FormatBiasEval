However, we can infer that the document is about the IBM 2016 English Conversational Telephone Speech Recognition System. So, we can assume that the tasks related to this system could be speech recognition or natural language processing.

Here's the Python dictionary with the inferred tasks:

However, I can give you an example of how you might extract task entities from your document using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and libraries like spaCy or NLTK.

Here's an example using spaCy:

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load(""en_core_web_sm"")

document = nlp(""Rethinking the Inception Architecture for Computer Vision"")

task_entities = []

for ent in document.ents:
    if ent.label_ == ""TASK"":
        task_entities.append(ent.text)

output = {'Task': task_entities}
print(output)
```

In this example, we first load the English language model from spaCy. We then process the document using the `nlp()` function, which returns a `Doc` object. We iterate through the named entities in the document and check if their label is ""TASK"". If so, we add the text of the entity to our list of task entities. Finally, we create a dictionary with the key ""Task"" and the value being our list of task entities, and print the output.

Note that in order for this code to work, you need to have spaCy installed and the English language model downloaded. You can install spaCy using pip:

```bash
pip install spacy
```

And you can download the English language model using the following command:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

First, you need to install spaCy and download the English language model:

```bash

python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

Then, you can use the following Python code to extract task entities from the document:

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load(""en_core_web_sm"")

document = ""document : Natural Language Inference over Interaction Space""
doc = nlp(document)

task_entities = []

for ent in doc.ents:

        task_entities.append(ent.text)

output = {'Task': task_entities}

However, I can give you an example of how you might extract task entities from a given document using Python and a Natural Language Processing (NLP) library like spaCy or NLTK.

Here's an example using spaCy:

```python
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load(""en_core_web_sm"")

document = [""Your document text goes here""]

task_entities = []

for doc in nlp.pipe(document):
    for ent in doc.ents:

            task_entities.append(ent.text)

output = {'Task': task_entities}
print(output)
```

In this example, we first load the English language model from spaCy. We then process the document text using the `pipe()` method, which applies various NLP processing steps to each sentence in the document. For each processed document, we iterate through the named entities (`ents`) and check if the entity label is ""TASK"". If it is, we add the entity text to our list of task entities. Finally, we create a dictionary with the key ""Task"" and the value being our list of task entities, and print the output.

Keep in mind that you'll need to have the spaCy library installed and the English language model downloaded for this example to work. You can install spaCy using pip:

```bash
pip install spacy
```

And you can download the English language model using the following command:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

In this example, we first load the English language model from spaCy. We then process the document using the `nlp` object and extract named entities using the `ents` property. We check if each named entity has the label ""TASK"" and add it to the `task_entities` list if it does. Finally, we create a dictionary with the key ""Task"" and the value as the list of task entities and print it out.

Note that in order for this code to work, you need to have spaCy installed and the English language model downloaded. You can install spaCy using pip:

```bash
pip install spacy
```

And download the English language model:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

S0031920113000708,"Geomagnetic jerks are conspicuous yet poorly understood phenomena of Earth’s magnetic field, motivating investigations of their morphology and the theory behind their origins. Jerks are most commonly defined by their observed form at a single observatory as ‘V’ shapes in a single component of the geomagnetic secular variation (SV), the first time derivative of the main magnetic field (MF). The times of the gradient changes, which separate linear trends of several years, have associated step changes in the second time derivative of the MF (secular acceleration (SA)) and impulses in the third time derivative. The ‘V’ shape SV definition of jerks includes an implicit expectation of a ‘large’ magnitude step change in the gradient without definition of this scale or its threshold value other than the basic need for it to be observable in the data above the highly variable background noise. Jerks can be described by their amplitude, that is, the difference in the gradients of the two linear SV segments about a jerk, A=a2-a1, where a2 is the gradient after the jerk and a1 is the gradient before the jerk. This measure is essentially the best fit SA change across a jerk. Jerk amplitude is thus positive for a positive step in SA and negative for a negative step. Here we do not consider spatial extent in our definition and refer to individual features in one field component of a given observatory time series as a single jerk.","['Earth’s magnetic field', 'Geomagnetic jerks', 'geomagnetic secular variation', 'gradient changes', 'jerk', 'Jerk amplitude', 'jerks', 'Jerks', '‘large’ magnitude step change', 'magnetic field', 'main magnetic field', 'MF', 'SA', 'SA change', 'secular acceleration', 'secular variation', 'SV', 'SV segments']","[""geomagnetic jerks"", ""poorly understood phenomena"", ""Earth’s magnetic field"", ""investigations of morphology and origins"", ""defined by 'V' shapes"", ""single component of geomagnetic secular variation (SV)"", ""first time derivative of main magnetic field (MF)"", ""times of gradient changes"", ""step changes in second time derivative (secular acceleration SA)"", ""impulses in third time derivative"", ""large magnitude step change in gradient"", ""amplitude of jerks"", ""difference in gradients of two linear SV segments"", ""best fit SA change across a jerk"", ""positive step in SA"", ""negative step in SA""]",Geomagnetic jerks <SEP> conspicuous phenomena <SEP> Earth’s magnetic field <SEP> poorly understood <SEP> motivation <SEP> investigations <SEP> morphology <SEP> theory <SEP> origins <SEP> defined <SEP> observed form <SEP> single component <SEP> geomagnetic secular variation (SV) <SEP> first time derivative <SEP> main magnetic field (MF) <SEP> times of gradient changes <SEP> linear trends <SEP> several years <SEP> step changes <SEP> second time derivative <SEP> secular acceleration (SA) <SEP> impulses <SEP> third time derivative <SEP> 'V' shape SV definition <SEP> large magnitude step change <SEP> amplitude <SEP> difference <SEP> gradients <SEP> linear SV segments <SEP> positive step <SEP> negative step <SEP> spatial extent <SEP> individual features <SEP> given observatory time series <SEP> single jerk.,"* Geomagnetic jerks

S1574119215000796,"The proposed multihop routing protocol, PHASeR, applies the technique of blind forwarding in a MWSN, which increases the reliability of data delivery through its inherent use of multiple routes. This approach requires a gradient metric to be continuously maintained, which is problematic in a dynamic topology. The literature commonly uses either flooding or location awareness, however flooding creates large amounts of overhead and location determination schemes can often be inaccurate, power hungry and create the issue of the dead end problem. PHASeR uses a novel method of gradient maintenance in a mobile network, which requires the proactive sharing of only local topology information. This is facilitated by a global TDMA (time division multiple access) MAC (medium access control) layer and further reduces the amount of overhead, which in turn will decrease packet latency. PHASeR is also set apart by its use of encapsulation, which allows data from multiple nodes to be transmitted in the same packet in order to handle high volumes of traffic. It utilises node cooperation to create a robust multipath routing solution. As such, the contribution of this paper is a cross-layer routing protocol for MWSNs that can handle the constant flow of data from sensors in highly mobile situations.","['cross-layer routing protocol', 'cross-layer routing protocol for MWSNs', 'encapsulation', 'gradient maintenance', 'gradient metric', 'MAC', 'medium access control', 'mobile network', 'multihop routing protocol', 'MWSN', 'MWSNs', 'node', 'node cooperation', 'nodes', 'packet latency', 'PHASeR', 'sensors', 'TDMA', 'time division multiple access']","[""PHASeR"", ""multihop routing protocol"", ""blind forwarding"", ""MWSN"", ""reliability"", ""gradient metric"", ""dynamic topology"", ""flooding"", ""overhead"", ""location awareness"", ""accuracy"", ""power consumption"", ""dead end problem"", ""novel method"", ""gradient maintenance"", ""mobile network"", ""proactive sharing"", ""local topology information"", ""global TDMA MAC layer"", ""overhead reduction"", ""packet latency"", ""encapsulation"", ""high volumes of traffic"", ""node cooperation"", ""robust multipath routing solution"", ""cross-layer routing protocol"", ""MWSNs"", ""constant flow of data"", ""sensors"", ""highly mobile situations""]","Multihop routing protocol: PHASeR <br>

S1877750311000676,"One way to enforce this ratio is to use a probabilistic, ‘roulette wheel’ style lane selection policy. VISSIM, along with most simulation toolkits, offers methods to specify probabilistic routing whereby a defined percentage of vehicles are sent down unique routes. This is a piecewise technique that can be reapplied at various locations around a simulation. While these methods are attractive from a calibration perspective as exact representations of existing statistics can be ensured, the process is an unrealistic one as it assumes that drivers make probabilistic decisions at precise locations. So in this case when a vehicle arrives at a point prior to the weighbridges it is allocated one of the lanes based on the respective probabilities. It turns out that this method leads to significant variations in trip times depending on the initial random number seed, this can be seen in a graphic of the key areas of the simulation for the 2 different runs (Fig. 7). One of the benefits of graphical microsimulation is that the 2D and 3D simulations help the researcher to visualise a new scheme and its potential benefits but also to highlight unrealistic behaviour. Fig. 7 shows the congestion at the decision point for 2 different runs.

S0029549314001551,"An increase of neutron leakage from the core region can be achieved through modifications in the core geometry (usually by adopting a pan-cake geometry of the active core region at the expense of the general neutron economy). Extensive studies determined a set of core design modifications that optimised the total sodium void reactivity (becoming less positive). Among the most efficient design solutions identified is an enlarged sodium plenum above the active core region in combination with an absorber layer above the sodium plenum (to reduce neutron backscattering from the reflector region above the plenum). Fig. 19 shows the combined effect of different upper plenum thicknesses of the absorber and boron layers. It can be observed that the sequential increase of the layer's thickness converge to an asymptotic value of reactivity reduction slightly over 800pcm.

S0370269304008974,"Thus, the extension to the charmed analogue Θc(3099) provides an interesting test for the SDO sum rule and lattice calculations [17]. Here, the charm quark is quite heavy so that the constituent-quark picture may fit well and the JW prediction for the parity is expected to be reproduced from QCD. In fact, quenched lattice calculation finds the parity of Θc(3099) to be positive [28]. In the extension to the Θc(3099) sum rules, there are two important aspects, which make this sum rule different from the SDO sum rule. First of all, since the charm quark is too heavy to form quark condensate, it gives non-perturbative effects only by radiating gluons. The quark–gluon mixed condensate 〈s̄gsσ·Gs〉, which was the important contribution in the Θ+ sum rule, is replaced by gluonic operators in the heavy quark expansion that are normally suppressed. Secondly, the charm quark mass has to be kept finite in the OPE, which can be done by using the momentum space expression for the charm-quark propagator. This is different from the light-quark sum rule where the calculation is performed in the coordinate space and all the quark propagators are obtained based on the expansion with the small quark mass. Keeping these two aspects in mind, we construct QCD sum rules for Θc(3099) and see how they are different from the Θ+(1540) sum rule.","['charm quark', 'charm quark mass has to be kept finite in the OPE', 'charm-quark propagator', 'constituent-quark picture', 'extension to the charmed analogue Θc(3099)', 'gluonic operators', 'heavy quark', 'JW prediction', 'momentum space expression', 'OPE', 'QCD', 'QCD sum rules', 'quark condensate', 'quark–gluon mixed condensate', 'quark propagators', 'quenched lattice calculation', 'radiating gluons', 'replaced by gluonic operators in the heavy quark expansion', 'SDO sum rule', 'SDO sum rule and lattice calculations', 'see how they are different from the Θ+(1540) sum rule', 's̄gsσ·Gs', 'small quark', 'sum rule', 'the light-quark sum rule', 'Θ+ sum rule']","[""charmed analogue Θc(3099)"", ""SDO sum rule"", ""lattice calculations"", ""charm quark"", ""constituent-quark picture"", ""JW prediction"", ""parity"", ""quenched lattice calculation"", ""positive parity"", ""Θc(3099) sum rules"", ""heavy quark"", ""non-perturbative effects"", ""quark-gluon mixed condensate 〈s̄gsσ·Gs〉"", ""gluonic operators"", ""heavy quark expansion"", ""OPE"", ""charm quark mass"", ""momentum space expression"", ""charm-quark propagator"", ""light-quark sum rule"", ""coordinate space""]","SDO sum rule, lattice calculations, charm quark, constituent-quark picture, JW prediction, parity, quenched lattice calculation, positive parity, Θc(3099), heavy quark, non-perturbative effects, gluonic operators, heavy quark expansion, quark-gluon mixed condensate, OPE, momentum space expression, charm-quark propagator, coordinate space, light-quark sum rule.

S0370269304009141,"Longitudinal beam and target single-spin asymmetries have been at the center of the attention lately, since they have been measured by the HERMES and CLAS experimental Collaborations [1–4] and more measurements are planned. They were originally believed to be signals of the so-called T-odd fragmentation functions [5], in particular, of the Collins function [6–12]. However, both types of asymmetry can receive contributions also from T-odd distribution functions [13–16], a fact that has often been neglected in analyses. An exhaustive treatment of the contributions of T-odd distribution functions has not been carried out completely so far, especially up to subleading order in an expansion in 1/Q, Q2 being the virtuality of the incident photon and the only hard scale of the process, and including quark mass corrections.

S0021999114007876,"In this work, light propagation in a scattering medium with piece-wise constant refractive index using the radiative transport equation was studied. Light propagation in each sub-domain with a constant refractive index was modeled using the RTE and the equations were coupled using boundary conditions describing Fresnel reflection and transmission phenomenas on the interfaces between the sub-domains. The resulting coupled system of RTEs was numerically solved using the FEM. The proposed model was tested using simulations and was compared with the solution of the Monte Carlo method. The results show that the coupled RTE model describes light propagation accurately in comparison with the Monte Carlo method. In addition, results show that neglecting internal refractive index changes can lead to erroneous boundary measurements of scattered light. This indicates that the quality of the DOT reconstructions could possible be increased by incorporating a model for internal refractive index changes in the image reconstruction procedure.","['coupled system of RTEs', 'DOT reconstructions', 'FEM', 'Fresnel reflection and transmission phenomenas', 'image reconstruction procedure', 'light propagation in a scattering medium with piece-wise constant refractive index', 'Monte Carlo method', 'radiative transport equation', 'refractive index changes', 'RTE', 'simulations', 'solution of the Monte Carlo method']","[""light propagation"", ""scattering medium"", ""piece-wise constant refractive index"", ""radiative transport equation (RTE)"", ""sub-domains"", ""constant refractive index"", ""boundary conditions"", ""Fresnel reflection and transmission phenomena"", ""interfaces between sub-domains"", ""coupled system of RTEs"", ""finite element method (FEM)"", ""proposed model"", ""simulations"", ""Monte Carlo method"", ""accurate description"", ""neglecting internal refractive index changes"", ""erroneous boundary measurements"", ""scattered light"", ""quality of DOT reconstructions"", ""image reconstruction procedure"", ""model for internal refractive index changes""]",Light propagation in scattering medium <SEP> Piece-wise constant refractive index <SEP> Radiative transport equation (RTE) <SEP> Sub-domains <SEP> Constant refractive index <SEP> Boundary conditions <SEP> Fresnel reflection and transmission phenomena <SEP> Interfaces between sub-domains <SEP> Coupled system of RTEs <SEP> Finite Element Method (FEM) <SEP> Monte Carlo method <SEP> Accurately describes light propagation <SEP> Neglecting internal refractive index changes <SEP> Erroneous boundary measurements <SEP> Scattered light <SEP> DOT reconstructions <SEP> Incorporating a model for internal refractive index changes.,"* light propagation in scattering medium

S0021961413004321,"The thermodynamics of copper-zinc alloys (brass) was subject of numerous investigations. Brass is characterised by an excess enthalpy and excess entropy of mixing, both of which are negative. The enthalpic data were measured by solution calorimetry e.g., [1–3] and based on chemical potential data calculated from phase equilibrium experiments e.g., [4–6], the excess entropy of mixing could be evaluated e.g., [7–9]. This excess entropy contains both, the vibrational and the configurational parts. The excess vibrational entropy, defined as the deviation from the entropy of a mechanical mixture of the end members A and B (i.e., Smmechmix=XASmA+XBSmB), can be determined by measuring the low temperature heat capacity (5 to 300K) versus composition behaviour. The determination of the excess configurational entropy, i.e., the excess entropy coming from non-random atomic distributions and defects, is much more difficult.

If, however, reliable data of the total excess entropy (from enthalpic and chemical potential data) are available, the measurement of the excess vibrational entropy enables the determination of the excess configurational entropy simply by subtraction. Since configurational and vibrational entropies may have different temperature dependencies, it is worthwhile to separate the entropic effects. This is one aim of this study.

S002231151500032X,"Zirconium alloys are used as cladding to encapsulate fuel pellets in pressurised and boiling water nuclear reactors. Research into oxidation of these alloys has been significant since the introduction of the material. However, the microstructure and electro-chemical processes during oxidation are complex and many questions still remain unanswered. One such issue is the formation of lateral cracks near the metal-oxide interface. Small cracks have been seen to form continuously during oxidation, with large scale networks of lateral cracks forming cyclically every ∼2μm of oxide growth. These networks of cracks can be correlated with acceleration in the corrosion kinetics [1–7]. These lateral cracks might enable the link up of nano pores along grain boundaries perpendicular to the metal/oxide interface as reported in [8,9]. Experiments using Synchrotron X-Ray Diffraction (S-XRD) by both Polatidis et al. and Petigny et al., have separately shown that oxides formed on Zircaloy-4 are composed of monoclinic and stabilised tetragonal phases, with an ∼7% reduction in the tetragonal phase fraction from 1 to 3μm oxide growth [4,10]. One theory is that the lateral cracks may destabilise the tetragonal phase close to the metal-oxide interface.

S0098300413002720,"Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have been widely used in science and engineering problems. They attempt to model the ability of biological nervous systems to recognize patterns and objects. ANN basic architecture consists of networks of primitive functions capable of receiving multiple weighted inputs that are evaluated in terms of their success at discriminating the classes in Τa. Different types of primitive functions and network configurations result in varying models (Hastie et al., 2009; Rojas, 1996). During training network connection weights are adjusted if the separation of inputs and predefined classes incurs an error. Convergence proceeds until the reduction in error between iterations reaches a decay threshold (Kotsiantis, 2007; Rojas, 1996).

S0370269304009049,"One of the challenges in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) is the relativistic bound state problem. In the light-cone Hamiltonian approach [1] light-cone wave functions can be constructed in a boost invariant way. It is necessary to have reliable light-cone wave functions if one wants to calculate high energy scattering, especially exclusive reactions. Many parametrizations assume separability of the dependence on the longitudinal momentum fraction and transverse momentum which is very unlikely since the two momenta are coupled in the kinetic energy operator. Various approaches have been tried to compute such wave functions. One can use the usual equal time Hamiltonian [2] and transform the resulting wave functions into light-cone form with the help of kinematical on-shell equations. The light-cone Hamiltonian in a string picture is formulated in Ref. [3]. More ambitious is the construction of an effective Hamiltonian including the gauge degrees of freedom explicitly and then solving the bound state problem. For mesons this approach [4,5] still needs many parameters to be fixed.

[8] describes the fundamentals of this method as applied by code developed in-house at Nottingham; since these are widely documented the details are not reproduced here, simply a summary. It applies an explicit time stepping approach to numerically integrate the translational and rotational motion of each particle from the resulting forces and moments acting on them at each timestep. The inter-particle and particle wall contacts are modelled using the linear spring–dashpot–slider analogy. Contact forces are modelled in the normal and tangential directions with respect to the line connecting the particles centres. Particle elastic stiffness is set so sphere “overlap” is not significant and moderate contact damping is applied. Particle cohesion can also be modelled but is assumed to be negligible in the current study. The translational and rotational motion of each particle is modelled using a half step leap-frog Verlet numerical integration scheme to update particle positions and velocities. Near-neighbour lists are used to increase the computational efficiency of determining particle contacts and a zoning method is used each time the list is composed; that is the system is divided into cubic regions, each particle centre is within one zone, and potential contacting particles are within the same or next-door neighbour zones.

S136481521630305X,"Using measured data from two arable sites in the UK we have shown that lags can have significant impact on model evaluation and can affect both the level of correlation between measured and simulated data and the magnitude of the sums of the residuals. Also, we used the division of MSE to three constituent statistics (SB, SDSD and LCS) to show how the level of correlation can affect the sum of residuals. By dividing the algorithm-predicted series of lag values into monthly sets and examining the frequency distribution of the lags, certain patterns in these temporally patchy series have been identified. A challenging task in relation to time lags between observed and simulated daily data, is to determine their cause. This task becomes more difficult for model outputs such as soil N2O emissions that are driven by various interacting variables. Even more so, because the measured N2O datasets and the measured datasets of their drivers (e.g. soil moisture, soil N content) cover small time periods, they are not continuous and can vary widely in size.

S0167931714004456,"PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane) has become by far the most popular material in the academic microfluidics community because it is inexpensive, easy to fabricate by replication of molds made using rapid prototyping or other techniques, flexible, optically transparent, biocompatible and its fabrication does not require high capital investment and cleanroom conditions. Various techniques have been adapted to fabricate microfluidic structures in PDMS, including wet and dry etching [20–22], photolithographic patterning of a photosensitive PDMS [23], and laser ablation [24]. But, it was the “soft-lithography” techniques [25] introduced by Whitesides et al. that enabled the widespread use of PDMS and opened up the era of PDMS-based microfluidics in the late 1990s. Replica molding, which is the casting of prepolymer against a master and generating a replica of the master in PDMS, has become a standard fabrication technique available in almost every research laboratory. Detailed overviews of soft-lithography techniques and their applications can be found from the reviews by McDonald et al. [26] and Sia et al. [27]. Nowadays, many tools dedicated for this purpose are available and can be purchased as a complete set (e.g. SoftLithoBox® provided by Elveflow (USA) [28]).

The goal of this approach is to treat the nodes on the contact surface in a manner similar to an internal node. The physical properties of the slave surface are interpolated to a ghost mesh (termed phony elements in [17]) that overlays the slave zones.

The surface area weights are equal to the ratio of the ghost zone surface area to the surface area of the master surface. The contact surface method for nodal-based Lagrangian cell-centered hydrodynamics (CCH) presented in this paper will use surface area weights similar in concept to those in TOODY.

S0003491615001955,"A fluctuating vacuum is a general feature of quantum fields, of which the free Maxwell field considered in  [1–12] is but one example. Fermionic fields such as that describing the electron, also undergo vacuum fluctuations, consequently one expects to find Casimir effects associated with such fields whenever they are confined in some way. Such effects were first investigated in the context of nuclear physics, within the so-called “MIT bag model” of the nucleon  [13]. In the bag-model one envisages the nucleon as a collection of fermionic fields describing confined quarks. These quarks are subject to a boundary condition at the surface of the ‘bag’ that represents the nucleon’s surface. Just as in the electromagnetic case, the bag boundary condition modifies the vacuum fluctuations of the field, which results in the appearance of a Casimir force  [14–18]. This force, although very weak at a macroscopic scale, can be significant on the small length scales encountered in nuclear physics. It therefore has important consequences for the physics of the bag-model nucleon  [19].","['a collection of fermionic fields describing confined quarks', 'bag-model nucleon', 'Casimir effects', 'Casimir force', 'Fermionic fields', 'fluctuating vacuum', 'free Maxwell field', '“MIT bag model” of the nucleon', 'nuclear physics', 'nucleon', 'quantum fields', 'such fields', 'the bag boundary condition modifies the vacuum fluctuations of the field', 'undergo vacuum fluctuations']","[""fluctuating vacuum"", ""quantum fields"", ""free Maxwell field"", ""Fermionic fields"", ""electron"", ""Casimir effects"", ""nuclear physics"", ""MIT bag model"", ""nucleon"", ""fermionic fields describing confined quarks"", ""boundary condition"", ""bag surface"", ""vacuum fluctuations"", ""Casimir force"", ""macroscopic scale"", ""small length scales"", ""physics of the bag-model nucleon""]",Fluctuating vacuum <SEP> quantum fields <SEP> free Maxwell field <SEP> electromagnetic case <SEP> Fermionic fields <SEP> electron <SEP> Casimir effects <SEP> vacuum fluctuations <SEP> MIT bag model <SEP> nucleon <SEP> collection of fermionic fields <SEP> confined quarks <SEP> boundary condition <SEP> bag's surface <SEP> Casimir force <SEP> weak force <SEP> small length scales <SEP> nuclear physics <SEP> important consequences <SEP> bag-model nucleon.,"* Fluctuating vacuum in quantum fields

S0021999115007238,"An inherent problem of the phase-space discretisation is the spurious separation of energy into the discretised bins. This is called the “Garden Sprinkler Effect” and has been extensively studied in [48,49,20]. (In the Boltzmann transport community this is known as the ray effect.) To showcase this effect in the angular dimension, a large spatial domain (4000km×4000km) is simulated, with a monochromatic wave propagating over a long distance in deep water (d=10000m). For the spatial discretisation a structured triangle mesh is used, with an element edge length of 67km (Fig. 11(a)).

S0305440314001927,"Traditionally, archaeologists have recorded sites and artefacts via a combination of ordinary still photographs, 2D line drawings and occasional cross-sections. Given these constraints, the attractions of 3D models have been obvious for some time, with digital photogrammetry and laser scanners offering two well-known methods for data capture at close range (e.g. Bates et al., 2010; Hess and Robson, 2010). The highest specification laser scanners still boast better positional accuracy and greater true colour fidelity than SfM–MVS methods (James and Robson, 2012), but the latter produce very good quality models nonetheless and have many unique selling points. Unlike traditional digital photogrammetry, little or no prior control of camera position is necessary, and unlike laser scanning, no major equipment costs or setup are involved. However, the key attraction of SfM–MVS is that the required input can be taken by anyone with a digital camera and modest prior training about the required number and overlap of photographs. A whole series of traditional bottlenecks are thereby removed from the recording process and large numbers of archaeological landscapes, sites or artefacts can now be captured rapidly, in the field, in the laboratory or in the museum.

S0045782515001231,"Isogeometric analysis. The central idea of isogeometric analysis is to use the same ansatz functions for the discretization of the partial differential equation at hand, as are used for the representation of the problem geometry. Usually, the problem geometry Ω is represented in computer aided design (CAD) by means of NURBS or T-splines. This concept, originally invented in  [1] for finite element methods (IGAFEM) has proved very fruitful in applications  [1,2]; see also the monograph  [3]. Since CAD directly provides a parametrization of the boundary ∂Ω, this makes the boundary element method (BEM) the most attractive numerical scheme, if applicable (i.e., provided that the fundamental solution of the differential operator is explicitly known). Isogeometric BEM (IGABEM) has first been considered for 2D BEM in  [4] and for 3D BEM in  [5]. Unlike standard BEM with piecewise polynomials which is well-studied in the literature, cf. the monographs  [6,7] and the references therein, the numerical analysis of IGABEM is essentially open.

S0167931712002699,"As the progression towards smaller lithographic nodes continues it has become necessary to adopt thinner resist films to mitigate problems such as pattern collapse. To address the issue of reduced etch resistance of thin photoresist films the semiconductor industry has begun to develop multilayer processes where the pattern is first transferred into an intermediate organic hardmask with higher etch selectivity before final silicon pattern transfer [25–27]. In this paper we demonstrate how the introduction of such a multilayer process can also benefit nanosphere lithography by increasing achievable aspect ratios of silicon nanopillars without the need for complex etch processes requiring specialised and expensive equipment, but instead needing only a standard SF6/C4F8 inductively coupled plasma (ICP) mixed mode etch process at room temperature [28]. As intermediate layer material we used polyimide, which finds widespread use as encapsulation material for IC production. It is readily patterned in oxygen plasma and has a lower etch rate than silicon in SF6 gas. Its flexibility can also be used for the fabrication of soft polymer pillars by the same process as we will show. The multilayer process slightly increases the complexity of sample preparation but allows basic ICP etching to achieve high aspect ratio structures at smaller feature sizes that previously reported without the need for complex etching equipment.","['complex etch processes', 'coupled plasma', 'encapsulation material', 'etching equipment', 'fabrication of soft polymer pillars', 'ICP', 'ICP etching', 'IC production', 'intermediate layer material', 'intermediate organic hardmask', 'multilayer process', 'multilayer processes', 'nanosphere lithography', 'oxygen plasma', 'pattern collapse', 'polyimide', 'reduced etch resistance of thin photoresist films', 'sample preparation', 'SF6 gas', 'silicon', 'silicon nanopillars', 'silicon pattern transfer', 'smaller lithographic nodes', 'thinner resist films', 'thin photoresist films']","[""smaller lithographic nodes"", ""thinner resist films"", ""pattern collapse"", ""semiconductor industry"", ""multilayer processes"", ""intermediate organic hardmask"", ""higher etch selectivity"", ""final silicon pattern transfer"", ""nanosphere lithography"", ""achievable aspect ratios"", ""silicon nanopillars"", ""standard SF6/C4F8 ICP mixed mode etch process"", ""room temperature"", ""polyimide"", ""encapsulation material"", ""IC production"", ""oxygen plasma"", ""lower etch rate"", ""SF6 gas"", ""flexibility"", ""soft polymer pillars"", ""sample preparation"", ""complexity"", ""high aspect ratio structures"", ""smaller feature sizes"", ""complex etching equipment""]",smaller lithographic nodes <SEP> thinner resist films <SEP> pattern collapse <SEP> multilayer processes <SEP> intermediate organic hardmask <SEP> higher etch selectivity <SEP> final silicon pattern transfer <SEP> nanosphere lithography <SEP> achievable aspect ratios <SEP> silicon nanopillars <SEP> standard SF6/C4F8 ICP mixed mode etch process <SEP> room temperature <SEP> polyimide <SEP> encapsulation material <SEP> IC production <SEP> oxygen plasma <SEP> lower etch rate <SEP> SF6 gas <SEP> flexibility <SEP> soft polymer pillars <SEP> sample preparation <SEP> high aspect ratio structures <SEP> smaller feature sizes <SEP> complex etching equipment.,"* smaller lithographic nodes

S0263822312001468,"Recently together with structural efficiency, passenger safety is also an important issue in application of material to transportation industries. Hence, the crashworthiness parameters are introducing to predict the capability of structure to prevent the massive damage and protect the passenger in the event of a crash. Crashworthiness parameters for various thin-walled tubes made from metal or fibre/resin composites in different geometries have been studied. A critical difference of tubular composites failure modes compared with metallic is the brittle collapse. In addition, in composites, tubular failure modes are involved with micro-cracking development, delamination, fibre breakage, etc., instead of plastic deformation. Implementation of composite materials in the field of crashworthiness is attributed to Hull, who in 80s and 90s of the last century studied extensively the crushing behaviour of fibre reinforced composite material. He found that the composite materials absorbed high energy in the face of the fracture surface energy mechanism rather than plastic deformation as observed for metals [1]. This observation has inspired others to further investigation about crashworthiness characteristics of composite materials.

S0370269304009037,"Within a coalescence approach as successfully applied earlier in the light-quark sector, we have evaluated transverse-momentum dependencies of charmed hadrons in central heavy-ion reactions at RHIC. For the charm-quark distributions at hadronization we have considered two limiting scenarios, i.e., no reinteractions (using spectra from PYTHIA) and complete thermalization with transverse flow of the bulk matter. The resulting J/ψ (mT-)spectra differ in slope by up to a factor of 2 (harder for pQCD c-quarks), and the integrated yield is about a factor of 3 larger in the thermal case.

The elliptic flow pattern of D-mesons was found to be essentially preserved in the single-electron decay spectra, rendering the latter a very promising observable to address the strength of charm reinteractions in the QGP.

S187775031300077X,"Although mean-field models have been used in all these settings, little analysis has been done on their behaviour as spatially extended dynamical systems. In part, this is due to their staggering complexity. The Liley model [15] considered here, for instance, consists of fourteen coupled Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) with strong nonlinearities, imposed by coupling between the mean membrane potentials and the mean synaptic inputs. The model can be reduced to a system of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) by considering only spatially homogeneous solutions, and the resulting system has been examined in detail using numerical bifurcation analysis (see [16] and references therein). In order to compute equilibria, periodic orbits and such objects for the PDE model, we need a flexible, stable simulation code for the model and its linearization that can run in parallel to scale up to a domain size of about 2500cm2, the size of a full-grown human cortex.

S0032386108009397,"The viscoelastic behavior of elastomers containing small amounts of unattached chains has been investigated to characterize the dynamics of the polymer chains trapped in fixed networks [66–68]. Polymer chains trapped in fixed networks constitute a simpler system for the study of the polymer chain dynamics than the corresponding uncrosslinked polymer melts. This is because the complicated effect of the motion of the surrounding chains on the dynamics of the probe chain – called “constraint release” [69] – is absent in the fixed network systems. Most of the earlier studies employed randomly crosslinked elastomers as host networks. In this case, precise control of the mesh size of the host networks is not possible, and the mesh size has a broad distribution. The end-linking systems give the host networks a more uniform mesh size, and they can control the mesh size by the size of the precursor chains. We investigated the dynamic viscoelasticity of end-linked PDMS elastomers containing unattached linear PDMS as functions of the size of the unattached chains (Mg) and the network mesh (Mx) (Fig. 9a) [70]. We employed two types of host networks with Mx>Me and Mx<Me where Me (≈10,000 for PDMS) is the molecular mass between adjacent entanglements in the molten state. The Mx>Me and Mx<Me networks (designated as NL and NS, respectively) were designed by end-linking the long (Mn=84,000) and short precursor chains (Mn=4,550), respectively.

S0009261412006513,"Water is the most important liquid, and the nature of its structure remains a topic of keen debate and an active area of research [1–9]. Much of this debate centers around whether water has a mainly tetrahedral structure with a continuum of distorted hydrogen bonds, or if it contains a mixture of two distinct components. One major development in recent years is the application of inner-shell spectroscopic techniques, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) at the oxygen K-edge to investigate the structure of water [2,10–12]. These methods can provide a direct structural probe of water, providing insight into the nature of its hydrogen bonding network. Theoretical studies play a critical role in these studies, since the analysis of the experimental data requires calculations to provide a link between the observed spectral features and the underlying structure. However, the simulation of the XAS or XES for liquid water presents a difficult challenge because it requires accurate molecular dynamics simulations to provide a correct description of the molecular structure coupled with accurate calculations of the spectral properties, i.e. excitation energies and line intensities.

S0032386107010518,"Copper-catalyzed Huisgen cycloadditions have been recently extensively studied by polymer chemists for the synthesis of functional polymers (either end-functional or side-functional). The post-functionalization of synthetic polymers is an important feature of macromolecular engineering as many polymerization mechanisms are rather sensitive to the presence of bulky or functional groups. For example, a wide variety of telechelic polymers (i.e. polymers with defined chain-ends) can be efficiently prepared using a combination of atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and CuAAC. This strategy was independently reported in early 2005 by van Hest and Opsteen [31], Lutz et al. [32], and Matyjaszewski et al. [33]. Such step was important since ATRP is a very popular polymerization method in modern materials science [34,35]. Indeed, ATRP is a facile technique, which allows the preparation of well-defined polymers with narrow molecular weight distribution, predictable chain length, controlled microstructure, defined chain-ends and controlled architecture [36–41]. However, the range of possibilities of ATRP can be further broadened by CuAAC. For instance, the ω-bromine chain-ends of polymers prepared by ATRP can be transformed into azides by nucleophilic substitution and subsequently reacted with functional alkynes (Scheme 3) [32]. Due to the very high chemoselectivity of CuAAC, this method is highly modular and may be used to synthesize a wide range of ω-functional polymers. Moreover, the formed triazole rings are not “passive” spacers but interesting functions exhibiting H-bonds capability, aromaticity and rigidity.","['alkynes', 'atom transfer radical polymerization', 'ATRP', 'azides', 'Copper-catalyzed Huisgen cycloadditions', 'CuAAC', 'functional polymers', 'H-bonds', 'macromolecular engineering', 'nucleophilic substitution', 'polymerization', 'polymers', 'polymers with defined chain-ends', 'preparation of well-defined polymers', 'synthesis of functional polymers', 'synthetic polymers', 'telechelic polymers', 'triazole rings', 'ω-bromine chain-ends of polymers', 'ω-functional polymers']","[""Copper-catalyzed Huisgen cycloadditions"", ""polymer chemists"", ""synthesis of functional polymers"", ""post-functionalization of synthetic polymers"", ""macromolecular engineering"", ""atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP)"", ""CuAAC"", ""telechelic polymers"", ""nucleophilic substitution"", ""functional alkynes"", ""highly modular"", ""wide range of ω-functional polymers"", ""triazole rings"", ""H-bonds capability"", ""aromaticity"", ""rigidity""]","Copper-catalyzed Huisgen cycloadditions <SEP>

S1364815216303061,"In representing wetland-river interactions involving GIWs, many models assume that the wetland can discharge into a river but cannot receive overbank flows from it. In such models, the volume of water (or water level elevation) in a wetland and its corresponding threshold value (predominantly controlled by outlet elevation) are the prime determinants of wetland outflow (Feng et al., 2012; Hammer and Kadlec, 1986; Johnson et al., 2010; Kadlec and Wallace, 2009; Powell et al., 2008; Voldseth et al., 2007; Wen et al., 2013; Zhang and Mitsch, 2005). However, in regions characterised by widespread riparian wetlands that are hydraulically connected with adjacent rivers, wetland-river interaction is likely to be bidirectional. Such interactions should be quantified according to hydraulic principles involving relative river and wetland water level elevations as well as the properties of the connection between the two (Kouwen, 2013; Liu et al., 2008; Min et al., 2010; Nyarko, 2007; Restrepo et al., 1998). In the WATFLOOD model, for instance, riparian wetland-river interaction is modelled using the principle of Dupuit-Forchheimer lateral/radial groundwater flow (Kouwen, 2013).

S0021999115001412,"Inspired by energy-fueled phenomena such as cortical cytoskeleton flows [46,45,32] during biological morphogenesis, the theory of active polar viscous gels has been developed [37,33]. The theory models the continuum, macroscopic mechanics of a collection of uniaxial active agents, embedded in a viscous bulk medium, in which internal stresses are induced due to dissipation of energy [41,58]. The energy-consuming uniaxial polar agents constituting the gel are modeled as unit vectors. The average of unit vectors in a small local volume at each point defines the macroscopic directionality of the agents and is described by a polarization field. The polarization field is governed by an equation of motion accounting for energy consumption and for the strain rate in the fluid. The relationship between the strain rate and the stress in the fluid is provided by a constitutive equation that accounts for anisotropic, polar agents and consumption of energy. These equations, along with conservation of momentum, provide a continuum hydrodynamic description modeling active polar viscous gels as an energy consuming, anisotropic, non-Newtonian fluid [37,33,32,41].

S0022311514008691,"The class of steels known as oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) ferritic alloys (also known as nanostructured ferritic alloys) consist of a dispersion of ultra-fine oxide particles throughout the matrix. These oxide particles serve to improve the mechanical properties of the system, particularly at high temperatures, of the system through inhibiting dislocation motion and grain boundary sliding. In nuclear applications the oxide particles have been suggested to act as point defect sinks [10,11] to improve radiation tolerance, and as preferential sites for the formation of nano-scale He bubbles therefore reducing swelling compared to non-ODS steels [12–15]. The ability of the oxide particles to improve these properties depends on the structure and composition of the particles [10,11,16,17] and their stability under irradiation. Typical compositions of ODS steels include between 9 and 14at.% Cr for oxidation resistance (most commonly 14at.%); W for solid solution hardening; Y2O3 that is put into solid solution during the initial, mechanical alloying, process but then during consolidation at high temperatures forms precipitates; and Ti to inhibit significant growth of the oxide particles; the balance being made up of Fe and impurities [18].

S0022311515301963,"Following fission, noble gas atoms will be distributed in the fuel matrix initially accommodated at point defects trap sites, generally thought to be Schottky trivacancy defects [4,5,31]. Diffusion to either bubbles or grain boundaries is then facilitated by associating a further uranium vacancy defect for the gas atom to ‘hop’ into, with the original vacancy then able to loop around to ensure continued diffusion. The rate determining step in the process is not the migration of the Xe itself but rather the rearrangement of the VU defect to facilitate net Xe diffusion [6–8]. Activation energies for the overall process depend on the availability of the defect trap sites, which in turn depends on the crystal stoichiometry. For Xe diffusion in UO2−x, UO2 and UO2+x the activation energies calculated using DFT are 7.04–12.92 eV, 4.15–7.88 eV and 1.38–4.07 eV with the ranges reflecting the way the calculations were performed depending on the charge states of the defects involved and the presence of a Jahn–Teller distortion [7].

In order to validate this conclusion, the experiment of Fig. 9 was performed. Specifically, a pair of nominally identical specimens was initially coupled by a 4.7kΩ resistor and their potential with respect to a saturated calomel electrode was recorded by using a NI-USB 6009 analog-to-digital converter. The electrochemical noise signal was recorded using in-house developed software, acquiring at 1023Hz segments of 1000 points at each iteration. Between iterations, the 1000 values acquired were averaged to obtain a single value of potential, subsequently saved to the file used for later processing. The final dataset comprised potential values spaced 1±0.05s in time. Under the assumption that the noise present above 1023Hz is negligible compared with the noise present below 0.5Hz, this procedure enables an accurate recording of the potential noise in the frequencies of interest, avoiding aliasing of frequencies between 0.5 and 1023Hz and minimizing the 50Hz interference from the mains supply.","['4.7kΩ resistor', 'accurate recording of the potential noise in the frequencies of interest', 'corrosion process', 'dataset', 'electrochemical noise signal', 'in-house developed software', 'NI-USB 6009 analog-to-digital converter', 'obtain a single value of potential', 'pair of nominally identical specimens', 'Rm', 'saturated calomel electrode', 'theoretical analysis', 'validate this conclusion', 'value of noise resistance', 'value of the measuring resistor']","[""theoretical analysis"", ""value of measuring resistor Rm"", ""corrosion process"", ""estimated value of noise resistance"", ""experiment"", ""Fig. 9"", ""pair of nominally identical specimens"", ""4.7kΩ resistor"", ""saturated calomel electrode"", ""NI-USB 6009 analog-to-digital converter"", ""electrochemical noise signal"", ""in-house developed software"", ""1023Hz segments"", ""1000 points"", ""iterations"", ""potential values"", ""time"", ""assumption"", ""negligible compared with"", ""noise present below 0.5Hz"", ""procedure"", ""accurate recording"", ""potential noise"", ""frequencies of interest"", ""aliasing"", ""minimizing"", ""50Hz interference"", ""mains supply""]","Theoretical analysis, Rm value, corrosion process, noise resistance, experiment, Fig. 9, nominally identical specimens, 4.7kΩ resistor, saturated calomel electrode, NI-USB 6009 analog-to-digital converter, electrochemical noise signal, in-house developed software, 1023Hz, 1000 points, iterations, potential values, time, frequencies of interest, aliasing, 0.5Hz, 1023Hz, negligible noise, 50Hz interference, mains supply.

S0168874X1630049X,"The crack band approach for producing mesh independent load–displacement curves for fracture in plain concrete is based on the idea that the crack opening is transformed into inelastic strain by distributing it over an element length dependent zone [5].

This requirement is an important difference to the nonlocal model which is designed to produce both mesh size independent load–displacement curves and strain profiles.

There are two kinds of co-catalysts in terms of its function: one is for separation of electrons and the other is for separation of holes. The former representative co-catalysts are Pt, Fe3+, and Cu2+ [9–12]. It was reported that Fe3+ and Cu2+ were grafted as amorphous oxide cluster [9,10], and reduced into Fe2+ and Cu+ by receiving one electron, respectively [11,12]. The reduced metal oxide cluster with reduced ions could return into the original state by giving more than one electron to molecular oxygen. The latter ones are CoOx, CoPi (CoPOx), IrOx, and RuOx which are used for water oxidation, among which CoPi is reported to be the most effective co-catalyst for water oxidation [13]. However, there were few reports concerning co-grafting effects on photocatalytic activity especially in gaseous phase.

S0370269304009104,"Though, in this Letter we have constructed the Born–Infeld black holes in the presence of a cosmological constant and discussed their thermodynamical properties, many issues however still remain to be investigated. We know that Reissner–Nordström AdS black holes undergo Hawking–Page phase transition. This transition gets modified as we include Born–Infeld corrections into account. We hope to carry out a detail study on this issue in the future. Furthermore, in the context of brane world cosmology, it was found that a brane moving in a Reissner–Nordström AdS background generates non-singular cosmology [14]. However, as shown in [15], the brane always crosses the inner horizon of the bulk geometry, creating an instability. It would be interesting to study cosmology on the brane when it is moving in the charged black hole backgrounds that we have constructed.

In this model high energy hadronic and nuclear collisions are treated within a self-consistent quantum mechanical multiple scattering formalism. Elementary interactions, happening in parallel, correspond to underlying microscopic (predominantly soft) parton cascades and are described effectively as phenomenological soft pomeron exchanges.

At high energies one accounts also for the contribution of perturbative (high pt) partons described by a so-called “semihard pomeron”—a piece of the QCD parton ladder sandwiched between two soft pomerons which are connected to the projectile and to the target in the usual way. The spectator partons of both projectile and target nucleons, left after pomeron emissions, form nucleon remnants. The legs of the pomerons form color singlets, such as q–q̄, q–qq or q̄–q̄q̄.

S0021999113005652,"This study proposes a new framework of a numerical modelling of the gas exchange between air and water across their interface, and subsequent chemical reaction in water based on an extended two-compartment model. The major purpose of this study is to provide a fundamental concept for modelling physicochemical processes of the gas exchange, followed by the chemical reaction in water. Demonstrating fundamental data and knowledge on the important environmental transport phenomena, especially the effects of the Schmidt number and the chemical reaction rate on the gas exchange mechanisms across the interface have also been attempted. The gas exchange processes are separated into two physicochemical substeps, the first is the gas–liquid equilibrium between the two phases, and the second is the chemical reaction in the water phase. A first-order, irreversible chemical reaction of the gaseous material after its uptake into the water phase is assumed here to simplify interactions of the chemical reactions and turbulent transport phenomena in water. While a traditional two-compartment model assumes uniform concentration of a material in each compartment, the present two-compartment model uses a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique in the water compartment to evaluate temporal development of three-dimensional profiles of the velocity and concentration fields. A direct numerical simulation (DNS) approach is used to evaluate profiles of fluid velocities and concentrations in water, and several important turbulence statistics have been evaluated without using turbulent closures, and subgrid-scale models. We assume that a fluid flow in the water phase is a well-developed turbulent water layer of a low Reynolds number, and the Schmidt number is varied from 1 to 8 to observe the effects of the molecular diffusion of the gas in sub-interface water on the gas exchange rate at the interface. Six degrees of the nondimensional chemical reaction rate are used to find the effect of the chemical reaction rate on the gas exchange mechanisms. Extrapolations of the gas exchange rates and the related transport phenomena toward larger Schmidt number and the faster chemical reaction rate will also be examined to predict the gas exchange processes of the actual gases of Sc∼O(102) based on results from the present numerical experiments.","['air', 'CFD', 'chemical reaction', 'chemical reaction in the water phase', 'chemical reaction in water', 'chemical reaction rate', 'chemical reactions', 'computational fluid dynamics', 'concentrations in water', 'direct numerical simulation', 'DNS', 'effect of the chemical reaction rate on the gas exchange mechanisms', 'effects of the Schmidt number', 'evaluate profiles of fluid velocities and concentrations in water', 'evaluate temporal development of three-dimensional profiles of the velocity and concentration fields', 'fluid flow in the water phase', 'fluid velocities', 'framework', 'fundamental concept', 'gas', 'gaseous material', 'gases', 'gas exchange', 'gas exchange mechanisms', 'gas exchange mechanisms across the interface', 'gas exchange processes', 'gas exchange rate at the interface', 'gas exchange rates', 'gas–liquid equilibrium', 'irreversible chemical reaction', 'liquid', 'modelling physicochemical processes', 'molecular diffusion', 'new framework of a numerical modelling', 'nondimensional chemical reaction rate', 'numerical experiments', 'observe the effects of the molecular diffusion', 'predict the gas exchange processes', 'Sc∼O(102)', 'subgrid-scale models', 'transport phenomena', 'turbulent transport phenomena in water', 'two-compartment model', 'water', 'water phase']","[""new framework"", ""numerical modelling"", ""gas exchange"", ""interface"", ""subsequent chemical reaction"", ""two-compartment model"", ""extended two-compartment model"", ""fundamental concept"", ""physicochemical processes"", ""gas-liquid equilibrium"", ""chemical reaction in water"", ""first-order irreversible chemical reaction"", ""gaseous material"", ""computational fluid dynamics (CFD)"", ""direct numerical simulation (DNS)"", ""turbulence statistics"", ""well-developed turbulent water layer"", ""low Reynolds number"", ""Schmidt number"", ""molecular diffusion"", ""gas exchange rate"", ""nondimensional chemical reaction rate"", ""extrapolations"", ""larger Schmidt number"", ""faster chemical reaction rate""]",Numerical modelling <SEP> gas exchange <SEP> air and water interface <SEP> chemical reaction <SEP> extended two-compartment model <SEP> fundamental concept <SEP> physicochemical processes <SEP> Schmidt number <SEP> chemical reaction rate <SEP> gas-liquid equilibrium <SEP> chemical reaction in water <SEP> first-order irreversible chemical reaction <SEP> computational fluid dynamics (CFD) <SEP> temporal development <SEP> velocity and concentration fields <SEP> direct numerical simulation (DNS) <SEP> turbulence statistics <SEP> turbulent closures <SEP> subgrid-scale models <SEP> well-developed turbulent water layer <SEP> Reynolds number <SEP> nondimensional chemical reaction rate <SEP> extrapolations <SEP> larger Schmidt number <SEP> faster chemical reaction rate <SEP> actual gases <SEP> Sc∼O(102),"* Numerical modelling of gas exchange between air and water interface

S0375960113004908,"Topological insulators (TIs) are promising candidates of spintronics materials because of their robust helical surface states and the extremely strong spin–orbit interaction [1–3]. Initially, binary chalcogenides Bi2Te3, Sb2Te3 and Bi2Se3 have been identified as three-dimensional TIs by surface sensitive probes such as angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. Later, ternary chalcogenide (BixSb1−x)2Te3 [4,5], which has similar tetradymite structure to the parent compounds Bi2Te3 and Sb2Te3, was predicted by ab initio calculations and confirmed by ARPES measurements as a tunable topological insulator whose Fermi energy and carrier density can be adjusted via changing the Bi/Sb composition ratio with stable topological surface state for the entire composition range. Combined with magnetism or superconductivity, TIs have attracted great attention due to the rich variety of new physics and applications. The ferromagnetism in several transition metal (TM) doped TIs, which breaks the time-reversal symmetry, has been reported [6–13].

S0168365913003295,"A limitation of the pharmacyte approach is the one-time nature of the intervention: ACT T-cells can only be loaded once with a cargo of adjuvant drug prior to transfer, and the duration of stimulation is inherently limited by expansion of the cell population in vivo, since cell-bound particles are diluted with each cell division. We hypothesized that a strategy to target supporting drugs to T-cells with nanoparticle drug carriers directly in vivo would enable transferred lymphocytes to be repeatedly stimulated with supporting adjuvant drugs, and thereby provide continuous supporting signals over the prolonged durations that might be necessary for elimination of large tumor burdens. Such “re-arming” of T-cells with supporting drugs could be achieved by repeated administration of targeted particles, allowing adoptively-transferred T-cells to be restimulated multiple times directly in vivo, while the use of internalizing targeting ligands would minimize the likelihood of immune responses against the nanoparticle carrier. To our knowledge, only two prior studies have attempted to target nanoparticles to T-cells in vivo [17,18]. In both of these studies, particles were targeted to T-cells via peptide-MHC ligands that bind to specific T-cell receptors.

For this reason, in case of a suspicion disks are to be analysed with respect to ferromagnetic inclusions. These inclusions generate a magnetic density which can be measured by a flux gate magnetometer using the magnetic remanence method [1]. The detection principle of ferromagnetic impurities in non-magnetic metallic materials is based on their remanence. Before such a measurement can be carried out, the aeroengine turbine disks are premagnetised in axial direction.

In particular we have obtained the first global mean field partition function (Eq. (9)), for a system of finite number of particles.

S0045782513001448,"Traditionally, the simulation of incompressible fluid flow by the SPH method has been through a weakly compressible SPH formulation (WCSPH). In this approach, the pressure is treated as a thermodynamic variable and is calculated using an artificial equation of state. The sound speed is set to be sufficiently high to limit density variations to within a small fraction of the actual fluid density. In practice, this high sound speed places a limitation on the maximum permissible time-step size through the Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) constraint. A particular weakness relates to noise in the pressure field since a small perturbation in the local density will yield a large variation in the local pressure. This can make WCSPH formulations ineffective for accurate force and pressure prediction, although recent developments which create more uniform particle distributions have improved this [1,2].

S0032386109005485,"Inverse miniemulsion polymerization is a water-in-oil (W/O) heterogeneous polymerization process that forms kinetically stable macroemulsions at, below, or around the critical micellar concentration (CMC). This process contains aqueous droplets (including water-soluble monomers) stably dispersed, with the aid of oil-soluble surfactants, in a continuous organic medium. Stable inverse miniemulsions are formed under high shear by either a homogenizer or a high speed mechanical stirrer. Oil-soluble nonionic surfactants with hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) value around 4 are used to implement colloidal stability of the resulting inverse emulsion. Upon addition of radical initiators, polymerization occurs within the aqueous droplets producing colloidal particles (Fig. 2) [83].

S0168365913001521,"The mesoporous silica particles were prepared by the surfactant self-assembly method described previously [18,24]. Briefly, a homogeneous solution of the soluble silica precursor, tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS; Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO), and hydrochloric acid was mixed in ethanol and water. A surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB; Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO), with an initial concentration much less than the critical micelle concentration was added to lower the surface tension of the liquid mixture and act as the mesoporous structure-directing template. Aerosol solutions of soluble silica plus surfactant were then generated with nitrogen as a carrier atomizing gas using a commercially available atomizer (Model 9392A, TSI, Inc., St. Paul, MN). The aerosol droplets were solidified in a tube furnace at 400°C until dry. Once dried, a durapore membrane filter, kept at 80°C, was used to collect the particles. As a final step, the surfactant was removed at 400°C for 5h via calcination. The surface of the mesoporous silica core in these studies was chemically modified with 10wt.% or 15wt.% by aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES; Sigma-Aldrich Corp., St. Louis, MO) conducted identically as previously described [17] to create a positive surface charge to increase loading efficiency of negatively charged cargo.

S2352179115300041,"The main drawback of thermo-oxidation in most actual devices and ITER is its limitation to maintenance periods, when the vessel walls can be heated up around 300–400 °C by hot helium injection through the cooling system [19,20], and also because of the required reconditioning of the walls before plasma operation to remove the absorbed oxygen [10]. However, the temperature achieved is not homogeneous over the vessel, as it is limited to the distance to the cooling tubes, and thus to the device design. The analysis of this study is a continuation of previous works done for the treatment of ITER carbon co-deposits [1–3], so the temperatures studied are in the range of 350 °C for divertor and 200–275 °C for main wall and remote parts. At present, due to budget restrains as well as due to tritium trapped in co-deposited carbon layers, ITER will not use carbon materials at the divertor strike points in spite of their excellent resilience against large heat loads. Nevertheless, many present experimental nuclear fusion devices (DIII-D, TCV, etc.) and new ones (JT-60SA, KSTAR, Wenderstein-7X) use carbon elements, so the removal of carbon co-deposits is still necessary for a better device operation—plasma density control, dust events, etc. The temperatures used in this work are not very different from the ones achievable in present devices, such that the results can be extrapolated to them.

S0393044012000198,"RemarkThe purely radiative spacetimes used as reference solutions in our analysis are not perturbations of the Minkowski spacetime. A way of seeing this is to consider the Newman–Penrose constants of the spacetime. The Newman–Penrose constants are a set of absolutely conserved quantities defined as integrals of certain components of the Weyl tensor and the Maxwell fields over cuts of null infinity—see [19–21] for the Einstein–Maxwell case. In [22] it has been shown that the value of the Newman–Penrose constants for a vacuum radiative spacetime coincides with the value of the rescaled Weyl spinor at i+—this result can be extended to the electrovacuum case using the methods of this article. For the radiative spacetimes arising from the construction of [17] it can be seen that the value of the Weyl spinor at i+ is essentially the mass quadrupole of the seed static spacetime. It follows, that the Newman–Penrose constants of the radiative spacetime can take arbitrary values. On the other hand, for the Minkowski spacetime, the Newman–Penrose constants are exactly zero, and those of perturbations thereof will be small.

Molecular geometries of rhodamine dyes are well-known [27,28] and indicate that all the structures are non-centrosymmetric. In general, for centrosymmetric molecules, TPA is forbidden when tuned to the transitions at one-half of the excitation frequencies. However, for non-centrosymmetric molecules due to symmetry relaxations, the single-photon absorption (SPA) peaks and TPA peaks may coincide.

S2352179114200032,"Although the presented model is developed and tested with a-C:H layers in mind, it is not necessarily limited to them. Moreover, the only assumptions are chemical reactions between the gas and the solid forming volatiles, the loss of these volatiles from the material and the two stated boundary conditions of gas influx at a single outer surface and the possibility of reactions throughout the bulk. Porosity and significant gas inventories were observed not only for carbon [12] but, e.g. also for beryllium co-deposits [25] and can be expected for other co-deposits formed in plasma devices [1]. Thus, TCR and its description by the presented model may be applicable to all deposits.

S0098300413002951,"Hitherto, the investigation of fossil-orientation was only used for the topmost surface of fossil mass occurrences, deposited directly on the sea floor. Due to the fast development of virtual methods (e.g., macro-CT, µ-CT, nano-CT, etc.) it became possible, to investigate the interior orientation of such fossil mass occurrences in three-dimensional detail. Although, a series of paleontological studies deal with 3D-visualization of fossil-elements, no mass occurrence has previously been reconstructed three dimensionally for investigating their interior orientation. This study illustrates an interdisciplinary approach of virtual reconstruction, analyses and interpretation of the interior orientation of an ammonoid mass occurrence.

S0045782515001322,"One of the most important outcomes of the comparative analysis is the fact that in all tested cases the use of FM is associated with a dramatic reduction in computational time when compared with FE, generally being in the order of seconds for FM and in the order of hours for FE. Table 1 reports the timings of the simulations for both methods. Free expansion is the fastest case, where FM reaches the load-free configuration in just 2 s, while simulations inside the vessels with the diameter of around 30 mm take approximately 30 s. Most of the execution time of the FM deployment algorithm is dedicated to the contact check and calculations of the implications the vessel wall has on the stent structure. Interestingly, in both methods, the highest computational time (i.e., curved vessels) is not associated with the most complex geometry (i.e., patient-specific case of aortic dissection). Another fact worth mentioning is the relation of the computational time to the diameter of the vessel in both methods. While the computational time of FM appeared to be directly related to the diameter of the vessel, no immediate relation was found for the FE simulations. Such outcome is probably related to the simplified contact model used by FM, which makes the stent-graft expansion terminate once the nodes come in contact with the vessel wall.

Local field effects on spontaneous emission rates within nanostructured photonic materials for example are familiar, and have been well summarized [1]. Optical processes, including resonance energy transfer are similarly dependent on the local environment of molecular chromophores [2–4]. Many biological systems are known to contain complex organizations of molecules with absorption bands shifted due to the electronic influence of other, nearby optical centres. For instance, in widely studied light-harvesting complexes, there are two identifiable forms of the photosynthetic antenna molecule bacteriochlorophyll, with absorption bands centred on 800 and 850nm; it has been shown that the most efficient forms of energy transfer between the two occurs when there is a neighbouring carotenoid species 5–7. Until now, research on the broader influence of a neighbouring, off-resonant, molecule on photon absorption has mostly centred on the phenomenon of induced circular dichroism, where both quantum electrodynamic (QED) calculations [8–10] and experimental procedures [11–13] predict and verify that a chiral mediator confers the capacity for an achiral acceptor to exhibit circular differential absorption.","['absorption bands', 'achiral acceptor', 'atoms', 'carotenoid species', 'chiral mediator', 'circular differential absorption', 'electronic environment', 'electronic influence', 'energy transfer', 'experimental procedures', 'induced circular dichroism', 'influence of a neighbouring, off-resonant, molecule on photon absorption', 'light-harvesting complexes', 'local environment of molecular chromophores', 'Local field effects', 'molecule', 'molecules', 'nanostructured photonic materials', 'Optical processes', 'optical properties', 'photon', 'photon absorption', 'photosynthetic antenna molecule bacteriochlorophyll', 'QED', 'quantum electrodynamic', 'resonance energy transfer']","[""optical properties"", ""electronic environment"", ""local field effects"", ""spontaneous emission rates"", ""nanostructured photonic materials"", ""resonance energy transfer"", ""molecular chromophores"", ""absorption bands"", ""electronic influence"", ""nearby optical centres"", ""light-harvesting complexes"", ""bacteriochlorophyll"", ""absorption bands centred on 800 and 850nm"", ""energy transfer"", ""neighbouring carotenoid species"", ""broader influence"", ""off-resonant molecule"", ""photon absorption"", ""induced circular dichroism"", ""quantum electrodynamic calculations"", ""QED calculations"", ""experimental procedures""]",optical properties <SEP> atoms and molecules <SEP> electronic environment <SEP> local field effects <SEP> spontaneous emission rates <SEP> nanostructured photonic materials <SEP> resonance energy transfer <SEP> molecular chromophores <SEP> absorption bands <SEP> electronic influence <SEP> nearby optical centres <SEP> light-harvesting complexes <SEP> photosynthetic antenna molecule <SEP> bacteriochlorophyll <SEP> absorption bands centred on 800 and 850nm <SEP> efficient energy transfer <SEP> neighbouring carotenoid species <SEP> broader influence <SEP> off-resonant molecule <SEP> photon absorption <SEP> induced circular dichroism <SEP> quantum electrodynamic calculations <SEP> experimental procedures <SEP> chiral mediator <SEP> achiral acceptor <SEP> circular differential absorption.,"* optical properties of atoms and molecules

Moreover, BEM is ideal for solving problems in unbounded domains that occur in electrostatic field analysis. In gradient-based shape optimisation the shape derivative of the cost functional with respect to geometry perturbations is needed [9–11]. To this purpose, we use the adjoint approach and solve the primary and the adjoint boundary value problems with BEM. The associated linear systems of equations are dense and an acceleration technique, such as the fast multipole method [12,13], is necessary for their efficient solution.

The vibrational combination states of the alcohols are coupled by the femtosecond laser pulses at 1560nm. These couplings result in the absorption of 1560nm and the excited molecules undergo relaxation through non-radiative processes, which gives rise to transient thermal effects. These transient thermal effects are related to the pure optical nonlinearity of the samples and can be measured as a change in their n2 values [14].

Early studies (e.g., Linke, 1931; Linke and Ulmitz, 1940) identified the difficulty of separating the measurement of DNI from that of the diffuse irradiance in the immediate vicinity of the sun, hereafter referred to as circumsolar irradiance. Pastiels (1959) conducted a detailed study of the geometry of pyrheliometers, and how that geometry interacted with circumsolar radiance, using simplified representations of the latter. Various communications were then presented at a WMO Task Group meeting held in Belgium in 1966 (WMO, 1967) to improve the accuracy of pyrheliometric measurements, including estimates of the circumsolar enhancement. Ångström (1961) and Ångström and Rohde (1966) later contributed to the same topic, followed years later by Major (1973, 1980). The whole issue of instrument geometry vs. circumsolar irradiance was complex and confusing at the time because different makes and models of instruments had differing geometries.

S0021961414003255,"Moreover, one observes segregation effects by the XRD analysis, which probably took place at high temperature, and were partially quenched to room temperature. The phase analysis showed up to three distinct phases, which should have hence a distinct measurable phase transition temperature, if they crystallise from the liquid on the surface. In the thermograms these effects are not observable as different solidification arrest or clear inflections. The proportion of new appearing phases is small and therefore the latent heat released by this new phase will be also small. The reflected light signal technique only showed one phase change during cooling. As well, the location of this segregation cannot be determined exactly in the molten pool or later in the re-solidified material.

S0167931713002487,"Ge (100) wafers (n- and p-type) were cleaned in ultra high vacuum (<10−6mbar) at 500°C and 600°C for 10min to evaporate any native oxide and so achieve an oxide free surface. Subsequently, wafers were exposed to an Al flux for a range of times to deposit ultrathin Al layers. The samples were then oxidized at ambient temperatures in the MBE load lock to produce Al2O3 layers. The samples were transferred within 1min to an Oxford Instruments OpAL reactor and thin films of HfO2 were deposited on the Al2O3 using atomic layer deposition (ALD). The HfO2 depositions used a [(CpMe)2HfOMeMe] precursor coupled with an O2 plasma as the oxidizing species. Between 30 and 130 ALD cycles were used to grow HfO2 thicknesses from 1.6 to 7nm at 250°C. For electrical measurements, circular gold contacts of area 1.96×10−3cm2 were deposited onto the films to form MOS gate electrodes and Al was deposited on the back of the Ge wafers to provide an ohmic contact. After preliminary measurements, the samples were annealed in forming gas (FGA) at 350°C for 30min. The oxide leakage current was measured using a Keithley 230B voltage source and Keithley 617B electrometer.

S0370269304008858,"The reason to investigate the BFKL and DGLAP equations in the case of supersymmetric theories is based on a common belief, that the high symmetry may significantly simplify the structure of these equations. Indeed, it was found in the leading logarithmic approximation (LLA) [10], that the so-called quasi-partonic operators in N=1 SYM are unified in supermultiplets with anomalous dimensions obtained from universal anomalous dimensions γuni(j) by shifting its arguments by an integer number. Further, the anomalous dimension matrices for twist-2 operators are fixed by the superconformal invariance [10]. Calculations in the maximally extended N=4 SYM, where the coupling constant is not renormalized, give even more remarkable results. Namely, it turns out, that here all twist-2 operators enter in the same multiplet, their anomalous dimension matrix is fixed completely by the super-conformal invariance and its universal anomalous dimension in LLA is proportional to Ψ(j−1)−Ψ(1), which means, that the evolution equations for the matrix elements of quasi-partonic operators in the multicolor limit Nc→∞ are equivalent to the Schrödinger equation for an integrable Heisenberg spin model [11,12]. In QCD the integrability remains only in a small sector of the quasi-partonic operators [13]. In the case of N=4 SYM the equations for other sets of operators are also integrable [14–16].

S0045782514001947,"Our procedure does not address the issue of how parameterizations can vary for different flow types. However, Edeling et al.  [9] carried out separate calibrations for a set of 13 boundary-layer flows. They summarized this information across calibrations by computing Highest Posterior-Density (HPD) intervals, and subsequently represent the total solution uncertainty with a probability-box (p-box). This p-box represents both parameter variability across flows, and epistemic uncertainty within each calibration. A prediction of a new boundary-layer flow is made with uncertainty bars generated from this uncertainty information, and the resulting error estimate is shown to be consistent with measurement data. This approach is helpful, but it might be extended further by modelling proximity across flows through a distance that would relate to the flow characteristics in order to borrow strength across calibrations instead of splitting the calibrations and then merging the outcomes afterwards.

S0377221716300984,"In this paper, we propose a general agent-based distributed framework where each agent is implementing a different metaheuristic/local search combination. Moreover, an agent continuously adapts itself during the search process using a direct cooperation protocol based on reinforcement learning and pattern matching. Good patterns that make up improving solutions are identified and shared by the agents.

S0379711215000223,"The mentioned difficulties associated with the calibration process inspired the concept of inverse modelling. In this case, the experimental data become entirely integrated in the calibration process and an optimization routine is used to quantify the best set of parameters which explain the observed pyrolysis behaviour (i.e. multivariable curve fitting). The most used experimental data for model calibration have been the mass loss rate and the surface temperature [10–12]. The optimization technique used is function of the number of variables and their interactions. In the past, only the few most uncertain parameters (i.e. the kinetics parameters) were generally used as potentiometers [13]. However, sophisticated mathematical procedures have been developed to increase the number of parameters optimized simultaneously (e.g. Genetic Algorithm (GA) [10,14] or Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE) [11]). Lautenberger and Fernandez-Pello [12] have recently investigated the influence that the choice of algorithm can have on the optimized parameters. They generated using their code GPYRO a set of synthetic data (mass loss rate and surfaces temperature) and tried with different algorithms to find back the set of input parameters.

S0370269304007695,"In summary, we have shown that one can describe the experimental data of the HERMES Collaboration for hadron attenuation on nuclei without invoking any changes in the fragmentation function due to gluon radiation. In our dynamical studies, that include the most relevant FSI, we employ only the ‘free’ fragmentation function on a nucleon and attribute the hadron attenuation to the deceleration of the produced (pre-)hadrons due to FSI in the surrounding medium. We find that in particular the z-dependence of RMh is very sensitive to the interaction cross section of leading prehadrons and can be used to determine σlead. The interaction of the leading prehadrons during the formation time could be interpreted as an in-medium change of the fragmentation function, which however could not be given in a closed form. The extracted average hadron formation times of τf≳0.3 fm/c are compatible with the analysis of antiproton attenuation in p+A reactions at AGS energies [17]. In an upcoming work we will investigate in detail the spectra for different particle species (π±,K±,p,p̄) to examine, if the formation times of mesons and antibaryons are about equal.

S000926141500651X,"Previous studies have shown that there are two main mechanisms for the development of radiation-induced DSBs [16,17]. For γ-ray radiation, single step is the main process to cause DSBs (see Figure 3b), which is attributed to the generation of number of ROS upon the incident of individual photon of γ-ray. Whereas photo-radiation causes DSBs through two step mechanism (Figure 3a) by reflecting that each single photon causes mostly single ROS and thus induces only single strand break. Then, when a second single strand break occurs where near the existing single strand break, DBS is caused, i.e., the two step mechanism. Summarizing the results and discussion we may conclude as that: (1) The significant protective effect of AA against photo-induced damage may reflect the effective diminish of ROS by AA. (2) For the γ-ray induced DSB, the protective effect by AA is a little bit weaker than the case of photo irradiation. This may be due to the generation of numbers of ROS by single photon of γ-ray. Surviving oxygen species against the diminishment effect by AA may cause DSBs. (3) As for the DSBs by ultrasound, damage is caused by the shockwave through the generation of cavitations [18]. Thus, the chemical effect of AA to diminish ROS is considered to be negligibly small for the protection of DSBs.","['AA', 'cavitations', 'DBS', 'development of radiation-induced DSBs', 'diminish ROS', 'DSBs', 'generation of number of ROS', 'photo', 'photo-induced damage', 'photo irradiation', 'photon', 'photon of γ-ray', 'photo-radiation', 'radiation-induced DSBs', 'ROS', 'shockwave', 'single photon of γ-ray', 'single step', 'single strand break', 'strand', 'two step mechanism', 'ultrasound', 'γ-ray induced DSB', 'γ-ray radiation']","[""DSBs development"", ""radiation-induced DSBs"", ""two main mechanisms"", ""γ-ray radiation"", ""single step mechanism"", ""ROS generation"", ""photo-radiation"", ""two step mechanism"", ""single strand breaks"", ""protective effect of AA"", ""photo-induced damage"", ""effective diminish of ROS"", ""γ-ray induced DSB"", ""protective effect by AA"", ""numbers of ROS"", ""surviving oxygen species"", ""ultrasound radiation"", ""shockwave"", ""generation of cavitations"", ""chemical effect of AA"", ""negligibly small protection""]","1. radiation-induced DSBs

The result is a set of orthogonal vectors sorted in descending order of achieved variance. The first of these vectors is that onto which the variance of the projection of the samples is maximum. In this sense, the original KPIs constitute the N-dimensional vector space basis, whereas the N^ synthetic KPIs represent the orthogonal vectors with the highest variance.

S0370269303017222,"In the bag model and in linear or harmonic oscillator confining potentials, the first excited S-state lies above the lowest P-state, making the predicted Roper mass heavier than the lightest negative parity baryon mass. Pairwise spin-dependent interactions must reverse the level ordering. As mentioned earlier, color-spin interactions fail in this regard [29], while flavor-spin interactions produce the desired effect. Since the q3 color wave function is antisymmetric, the flavor-spin-orbital wave function is totally symmetric. For all quarks in an S-state, the flavor-spin wave function is totally symmetric all by itself and leads to the most attractive flavor-spin interaction. If one quark is in a P-state, the orbital wave function is mixed symmetry and so is the flavor-spin wave function, and the flavor-spin interaction is a less attractive.

S0032386108010392,"Microhardness can be related to other macroscopic mechanical properties such as yield stress, σ, and elastic modulus, E, both derived from compression testing. For work-hardened metals, Tabor derived a direct proportionality between hardness and compressive yield stress: H≈3σ [20]. However, it was soon realized that Tabor's relationship only applies to materials that exhibit full plasticity [9,10]. Deviations from this relationship have been reported for a number of metals, glasses and polymers where the elastic strains are non-negligible [9]. Hence, the different expressions describing the correlation of hardness with conventional macroscopic mechanical properties rely on the validity of the above-mentioned elasto-plastic models. In this way, hardness and yield stress no longer hold direct proportionality but their relationship depends on the specific material properties, such as Poisson's ratio and elastic modulus [9,11–13].

S221450951400031X,"This phase was completed in 2005. Previous contracts had been procured with the contractor providing the detailed design. For this system the design was undertaken by Mott MacDonald. It was developed by looking at the systems installed previously and calculating what was actually required to achieve cathodic protection of the piers. This resulted in a significant reduction in the number of zones and monitoring probes. The varying amounts of steelwork in the beams had previously lead to up to 5 zones per beam, with multiple layers of mesh to achieve the design current density. On review of the data the operating current density was similar in all zones and so this was reduced to a single zone per beam. The encapsulation was susceptible to ASR and contained post tensioning and so it was decided to use a galvanic system based on Galvashield CC anodes from Fosroc. Our design did not include an option to allow depolarization of the galvanic system, but the contractor supplied one, such that the anodes could be remotely disconnected.

S0370269304007701,"Solitons present the possibility of extended objects as stable states within Quantum Field Theory. Although these solutions are obtained from semi-classical arguments in weak coupling limit, their validity as quantal states is justified based on the associated topological conservation laws. A more curious occurrence is that of fermionic zero-energy modes trapped on such solutions. Their presence requires, according to well-known arguments [1,2], an assignment of half-integer fermion number to the solitonic states. In the usual treatment, the back reaction of the fermion zero-modes on the soliton itself is ignored. However, the fractional values of the fermionic charge have interesting consequence for the fate of the soliton if the latter is not strictly stable. The reason for this is that if the configuration were to relax to trivial vacuum in isolation, there is no particle-like state available for carrying the fractional value of the fermionic charge. Dynamical stability of such objects was pointed out in [3], in cosmological context in [4,5] and more recently in [6–8].

S0022311514005480,"The second stress state is a tri-axial tensile stress designed to represent the zone ahead of an advancing crack tip. Micro-scale lateral cracks have been observed in the oxide layer, and appear to form very close to or at the metal–oxide interface (Fig. 1). Finite element analysis by Parise et al. indicated that these cracks form as a result of localised tensile stresses above peaks in the metal–oxide interface roughness [31]. These cracks are considered separate to any nano-scale cracks that might result from the tetragonal to monoclinic phase transformation. An assumption is made here that whether the micro-scale lateral cracks form via fracture of the oxide or by de-bonding at the interface a triaxial tensile stress state will still be present. In manufactured partially stabilised zirconia cracks would be expected to destabilise the tetragonal phase. This is simulated by applying tensile stress in direction 1, 2 and 3. As this the maximum stress at the crack tip is not known, the applied tensile stresses cover a range from 0.1GPa up to a maximum stress value of 2.2GPa as it is approximately equal to three times the fracture strength of bulk fracture strength for manufactured stabilized zirconia [34].

However, there is a fundamental difference in the conformation of the octyl side chains. Whilst for the single crystal phase at T=100K linearly extended chains are observed (Figure 5B), a defined rotation of the octyl chains relative to the terthiophene unit is found for the three thin film phases (Figure 5A). The rotation angle of about ±70° results from a twist of the first CC single bond at the link between the terthiophene unit and the octyl chain (see arrows Figure 5A). Two features of this rotated conformation are interesting. First, a molecule with rotated side chains represents the equilibrium state of an isolated single DOTT molecule as obtained by combined MD and VASP calculations [33].

S037596011300741X,"In exploring the WKB limit of quantum theory, Bohm [2] was the first to notice that although one starts with all the ambiguities about the nature of a quantum system, the first order approximation fits the ordinary classical ontology. By that we mean that the real part of the Schrödinger equation under polar decomposition of the wave function becomes the classical Hamilton–Jacobi equation in the limit where terms involving ℏ are neglected. In contrast to this approach, in this Letter we show that the classical trajectories arise from a short-time quantum propagator when terms of O(Δt2) can be neglected. This fact was actually already observed by Holland some twenty years ago: In page 269 of his book [6] infinitesimal time intervals are considered whose sequence constructs a finite path. It is shown that along each segment the motion is classical (negligible quantum potential), and that it follows that the quantum path may be decomposed into a sequence of segments along each of which the classical action is a minimum.

S0021999114008523,"A multi-physics description of a multiscale system is often referred to as a ‘hybrid’ model. In fluid dynamics, a typical hybrid combines a molecular treatment (a ‘micro’ model) with a continuum-fluid one (a ‘macro’ model), with the aim of obtaining the accuracy of the former with the efficiency of the latter [1–4]. The micro and macro models generally have characteristic timescales that are very different, which means that time-accurate simulations can be extremely challenging: the size of the timestep required to make the micro model stable and accurate is so small that simulations over significant macro-scale time periods are intractable. If the system is ‘scale-separated’, a physical (as distinct from numerical) approximation can be made that enables the coupled models to advance at different rates (asynchronously) with negligible penalty on macro-scale accuracy. E et al. [5] were the first to introduce and implement this concept in a time-stepping method for coupled systems, referred to in the classification of Lockerby et al. [6] as a continuous asynchronous (CA) scheme (‘continuous’ since the micro and macro models advance without interruption [5]).

S0010938X15301554,"AA 2024-T3 aluminium alloy is widely used for aerospace applications due to its high strength to weight ratio and high damage tolerance that result from copper and magnesium as the principal alloying elements and appropriate thermomechanical processing. The microstructure of the alloy is relatively complex and a number of compositionally-distinct phases have been identified [1]. Although possessing favourable mechanical properties, the alloy is relatively susceptible to corrosion and generally requires surface treatment in practical applications. The corrosion behaviour of the alloy is particularly affected by the presence of the intermetallic particles due to their differing potentials with respect to the alloy matrix [2–9]. Copper-containing second phase particles at the alloy surface are particularly detrimental to the corrosion resistance as they provide preferential cathodic sites [2,10]. One of the principle types of second phase particle that is important to the corrosion behaviour of the alloy is the S phase (Al2CuMg) particle [1,11]. Dealloying of S phase particles, which may account for ∼60% of the constituent particles in AA2024 alloys [11], is commonly observed when the alloy is exposed to an aggressive environment. The particles are considered as important initiation sites for severe localized corrosion in the alloy [11–22]. The dealloying of the S phase particles and the resulting enrichment of copper result in a decrease of the Volta potential with respect to the matrix and hence the dealloyed particles become active cathodic sites [23–25].","['AA2024 alloys', 'AA 2024-T3 aluminium alloy', 'aerospace applications', 'Al2CuMg', 'alloy', 'alloying elements', 'alloy matrix', 'cathodic sites', 'compositionally-distinct phases', 'constituent particles', 'copper', 'Copper-containing second phase particles', 'corrosion', 'corrosion behaviour', 'corrosion resistance', 'dealloyed particles', 'dealloying', 'decrease of the Volta potential', 'enrichment', 'intermetallic particles', 'magnesium', 'particles', 'second phase particle', 'S phase', 'S phase particles', 'surface treatment', 'thermomechanical processing']","[""AA 2024-T3 aluminium alloy"", ""high strength to weight ratio"", ""high damage tolerance"", ""copper and magnesium as alloying elements"", ""thermomechanical processing"", ""complex microstructure"", ""compositionally-distinct phases"", ""corrosion"", ""surface treatment"", ""intermetallic particles"", ""differing potentials"", ""alloy matrix"", ""copper-containing second phase particles"", ""favourable mechanical properties"", ""susceptible to corrosion"", ""S phase particle"", ""Al2CuMg"", ""dealloying"", ""constituent particles in AA2024 alloys"", ""important initiation sites"", ""severe localized corrosion"", ""Volta potential"", ""dealloyed particles"", ""active cathodic sites""]",AA 2024-T3 aluminium alloy <SEP> high strength to weight ratio <SEP> high damage tolerance <SEP> copper <SEP> magnesium <SEP> principal alloying elements <SEP> thermomechanical processing <SEP> complex microstructure <SEP> compositionally-distinct phases <SEP> favourable mechanical properties <SEP> susceptible to corrosion <SEP> surface treatment <SEP> intermetallic particles <SEP> differing potentials <SEP> alloy matrix <SEP> copper-containing second phase particles <SEP> alloy surface <SEP> preferential cathodic sites <SEP> S phase (Al2CuMg) particle <SEP> ∼60% of the constituent particles <SEP> dealloying <SEP> aggressive environment <SEP> severe localized corrosion <SEP> Volta potential <SEP> matrix <SEP> dealloyed particles <SEP> active cathodic sites.,"* AA 2024-T3 aluminium alloy

S0377025714000135,"This conclusion is a consequence of the high jet speeds and small nozzle diameters in combination with the relatively high viscosity solvent and modest molecular weights of the polystyrene, which results in high Weissenberg numbers and moderate values of the extensibility, L studied here. As discussed in earlier papers [3,6], other jetting fluid combinations, such as those of de Gans et al. [4], lie in a different jetting regime where full extension does not occur and relaxation time controls the viscoelastic behaviour. Consequently inkjet fluid assessment methods need to provide a full characterisation including both linear and nonlinear viscoelastic properties. This complexity suggests assessments of inkjet fluids might have to include jetting from sets of DoD print head devices with different sensitivities to all the various VE parameters [37], rather than reliance on testing without jetting.

S1364815216302705,"The main objective of this manuscript is to present and discuss the application of SLAMM to the New York coast. Although the base analysis considers a range of different possible SLR scenarios, the effects of various sources of uncertainties such as input parameters and driving data are not accounted for. In addition, refined and site-specific data are often not available requiring the use of regional data collected from literature and professional judgement in order to run the model. To ignore the effects of these uncertainties on predictions may make interpretation of the results and subsequent decision making misleading since the likelihood and probabilities of predicted outcomes would be unknown. A unique capability of the current version of SLAMM is the ability to aggregate multiple types of input-data uncertainty to create outputs accompanied by probability statements and confidence intervals. Uncertainty in elevation data layers have been considered by several modeling groups to various extents (Gesch, 2009; Gilmer and Ferdaña, 2012; Schmid et al., 2014). However, to the best of our knowledge, no other marsh migration model simultaneously accounts for the combined effects of uncertainty in spatial inputs (DEM, VDATUM, etc.) and parameter choices (accretion rates, tide ranges, etc.) on landcover projections. This added feature of SLAMM allows results to be evaluated in terms of their likelihood of occurrence with respect to input-data and parameter uncertainties. Further, by assigning wide ranges of uncertainty when appropriate, it permits the production of meaningful projections in areas where high-quality local data are not available.","['accretion rates', 'DEM', 'high-quality local data', 'landcover projections', 'marsh migration model', 'parameter choices', 'present and discuss the application of SLAMM to the New York coast', 'SLAMM', 'SLR', 'spatial inputs', 'tide ranges', 'VDATUM']","[""SLAMM application to New York coast"", ""SLR scenarios"", ""uncertainties"", ""input parameters"", ""driving data"", ""refined data"", ""site-specific data"", ""literature data"", ""professional judgement"", ""predictions"", ""interpretation of results"", ""decision making"", ""uncertainty in elevation data layers"", ""Gesch (2009)"", ""Gilmer and Ferdaña (2012)"", ""Schmid et al.

S0021999113005718,"Numerical simulation of the gas flow through such non-trivial internal geometries is, however, extremely challenging. This is because conventional continuum fluid dynamics, which assumes that locally a gas is close to a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, becomes invalid or inaccurate as the smallest characteristic scale of the geometry (e.g. the channel height) approaches the mean distance between molecular collisions, λ [1]. An accurate and flexible modelling alternative for these cases is the direct simulation Monte Carlo method (DSMC) [2]. However, DSMC can be prohibitively expensive for internal-flow applications, which typically have a geometry of high-aspect ratio (i.e. are extremely long, relative to their cross-section).

S0378381215301291,"Recently, fundamental (thermophysical property) research on ionic clathrate hydrates has experienced remarkable growth, particularly over the last ten years [21–30]. Previously, beginning with the first paper on unusual hydrates of tetrabutylammonium salts in 1940 [31], a number of studies could be found on ionic clathrate hydrates (hereafter, semiclathrate hydrates) [32–35] before the unified terminology semiclathrate hydrate was generally accepted. Semiclathrate hydrates have been attracting increased attention because of their promising applications as phase change materials for refrigeration systems and in gas capture and storage [36–41]. In addition, there is interesting speculation that semiclathrate hydrate may be regarded as a representative substance for the study of thermal conductivity in clathrate hydrate in general. This is because: (1) it can reduce characterization problems as a solid sample, since semiclathrate hydrate is formed around ambient temperature under atmospheric pressure and is easy to handle; (2) accurately measuring the thermal conductivity of semiclathrate hydrates, which have many similarities to clathrate hydrates, may make possible a deeper understanding of the unique (anomalous) behavior of the thermal conductivity of clathrate hydrates; and (3) currently, there are no experimental studies on the thermal conductivity of semiclathrate hydrates.","['clathrate hydrates', 'gas capture and storage', 'ionic clathrate hydrates', 'measuring the thermal conductivity', 'phase change materials for refrigeration systems', 'semiclathrate hydrate', 'semiclathrate hydrates', 'Semiclathrate hydrates', 'study of thermal conductivity', 'thermal conductivity', 'unusual hydrates of tetrabutylammonium salts']","[""ionic clathrate hydrates"", ""semiclathrate hydrates"", ""thermophysical property research"", ""fundamental research"", ""growth"", ""last ten years"", ""first paper"", ""1940"", ""tetrabutylammonium salts"", ""unusual hydrates"", ""increased attention"", ""promising applications"", ""refrigeration systems"", ""gas capture and storage"", ""thermal conductivity"", ""clathrate hydrate"", ""characterization problems"", ""solid sample"", ""ambient temperature"", ""atmospheric pressure"", ""easy to handle"", ""deeper understanding"", ""unique behavior"", ""anomalous behavior"", ""no experimental studies""]","Ionic clathrate hydrates, semiclathrate hydrates, previously studied, unusual hydrates of tetrabutylammonium salts, first paper, 1940, increased attention, promising applications, refrigeration systems, gas capture and storage, thermal conductivity, clathrate hydrate, solid sample, ambient temperature, atmospheric pressure, easier to handle, deeper understanding, unique behavior, anomalous behavior, experimental studies, thermal conductivity of semiclathrate hydrates.

S0370269302014880,"Production of charmonium states J/ψ and ψ′ in nucleus–nucleus collisions has been studied at CERN SPS over the previous 15 years by the NA38 and NA50 Collaborations. This experimental program was mainly motivated by the suggestion [1] to use the J/ψ as a probe of the state of matter created at the early stage of the collision. The original picture [1] (see also [2] for a modern review) assumes that charmonia are created exclusively at the initial stage of the reaction in primary nucleon–nucleon collisions. During the subsequent evolution of the system, the number of hidden charm mesons is reduced because of: (a) absorption of pre-resonance charmonium states by nuclear nucleons (normal nuclear suppression), (b) interactions of charmonia with secondary hadrons (comovers), (c) dissociation of cc̄ bound states in deconfined medium (anomalous suppression). It was found [3] that J/ψ suppression with respect to Drell–Yan muon pairs measured in proton–nucleus and nucleus–nucleus collisions with light projectiles can be explained by the so-called “normal” (due to sweeping nucleons) nuclear suppression alone. In contrast, the NA50 experiment with a heavy projectile and target (Pb+Pb) revealed essentially stronger J/ψ suppression for central collisions [4–7]. This anomalous J/ψ suppression was attributed to formation of quark–gluon plasma (QGP) [7], but a comover scenario cannot be excluded [8].","['absorption of pre-resonance charmonium states by nuclear nucleons', 'anomalous suppression', 'cc̄', 'central collisions', 'charmonia', 'charmonium', 'charmonium states', 'comovers', 'comover scenario', 'dissociation of cc̄ bound states in deconfined medium', 'Drell–Yan muon pairs', 'experimental program', 'formation of quark–gluon plasma', 'hadrons', 'heavy projectile and target', 'hidden charm mesons', 'interactions of charmonia with secondary hadrons', 'J/ψ', 'J/ψ suppression', 'light projectiles', 'NA50 experiment', 'normal nuclear suppression', 'nuclear nucleons', 'nuclear suppression', 'nucleon', 'nucleus', 'nucleus–nucleus collisions', 'original picture', 'Pb+Pb', 'primary nucleon–nucleon collisions', 'Production of charmonium states J/ψ and ψ′ in nucleus–nucleus collisions', 'proton–nucleus', 'QGP', 'quark–gluon plasma', 'subsequent evolution of the system,', 'sweeping nucleons', 'use the J/ψ as a probe of the state of matter created at the early stage of the collision', 'ψ′']","[""charmonium states J/ψ and ψ′"", ""production in nucleus–nucleus collisions"", ""NA38 and NA50 Collaborations"", ""probe of the state of matter"", ""initial stage of the reaction"", ""primary nucleon–nucleon collisions"", ""number of hidden charm mesons"", ""absorption of pre-resonance charmonium states"", ""normal nuclear suppression"", ""interactions of charmonia with secondary hadrons"", ""comovers"", ""dissociation of cc̄ bound states"", ""deconfined medium"", ""anomalous suppression"", ""J/ψ suppression"", ""Drell–Yan muon pairs"", ""proton–nucleus and nucleus–nucleus collisions with light projectiles"", ""normal nuclear suppression alone"", ""heavy projectile and target (Pb+Pb)"", ""central collisions"", ""anomalous J/ψ suppression"", ""quark–gluon plasma (QGP)"", ""comover scenario""]","Charmonium states J/ψ and ψ′ <SEP>

S0370269304006082,"The aim of this note is nothing more than to bring both approaches on equal footing and to relax the assumptions under which the results of [11,13] have been derived using the first approach. More concretely, we generalize the one-loop partition functions, as derived in [11,13] for levels being odd, to the case of even levels. Moreover, on the level of partition functions we implement additional dressings of the world-sheet parity symmetry and identify them with the dressings introduced in [12] in the crosscap state approach. As expected, all the physical information can be read off entirely from the various amplitudes. We will end up with a collection of very explicit and general one-loop partition functions and tadpole cancellation conditions covering simple current extensions of all 168 Gepner models with additional dressings of the parity symmetry. In fact providing a compact collection of the main relevant formulas for constructing supersymmetric Gepner model orientifolds was one of the motivations for writing this Letter.

S0009261413004612,"The control of the RP re-encounter probability finds a direct application to improve the performance of chemical devices. Here, we show how a simple-to-implement control scheme highly enhances the sensitivity of a model chemical magnetometer by up to two orders of magnitude. The basic idea behind a chemical magnetometer is that, since a change in the magnetic field modifies the amount of singlet products, one can reverse the reasoning and measure the chemical yield to estimate B. Intuitively, the magnetic sensitivity is high when a small change in the magnetic field intensity produces large effects on the singlet yield. Formally, it is defined as:(2)Λs(B)≡∂Φs(B)∂B=∫0∞pre(t)gs(B,t)dt,with gs(B,t)≡∂fs(B,t)∂B being the instantaneous magnetic sensitivity. The functional form of fs(B,t)=Sρel(t)S strongly depends on the specific realization of the radical pair, in particular on the number of the surrounding nuclear spins. Here, we consider a radical pair in which the first electron spin is devoid of hyperfine interactions, while the second electron spin interacts isotropically with one spin-1 nucleus, e.g. nitrogen. In the context of the chemical compass (i.e. when the task is determining the magnetic field direction through anisotropic hyperfine interactions), an analogous configuration (with only one spin-1/2 nucleus) has been proposed [3], and numerically characterized [8], as being optimal: Additional nuclear spins would perturb the intuitive ‘reference and probe’ picture.

The two-step decay model [26] was applied to explain the above-mentioned fragmentation of DCPD to CPD, shown in Figure 8a.

The best fit decay constants for the biexponential decay components of C10H12+ ion signal is τ1=35fs and τ2=240fs, while that for C5H6+ ion signal is τ1=36fs and τ2=280fs, respectively. These decay constants conform to the previously reported time constants of norbornene and norbornadiene [22,23].

These materials have two components, one being a semiconducting material with diamagnetic properties while the other is a magnetic dopant such as transition metal having un-paired d electrons [2]. The major advantage of these materials is utilization of electron's spin as information carrier since advanced functionalities in spintronic devices can be viable by the use of spin degree of freedom along with the charge of electrons [3].

S1524070312000380,"Isogeometric analysis (IGA) is a numerical simulation method which is directly based on the NURBS-based representation of CAD models. It exploits the tensor-product structure of 2- or 3-dimensional NURBS objects to parameterize the physical domain. Hence the physical domain is parameterized with respect to a rectangle or to a cube. Consequently, singularly parameterized NURBS surfaces and NURBS volumes are needed in order to represent non-quadrangular or non-hexahedral domains without splitting, thereby producing a very compact and convenient representation.The Galerkin projection introduces finite-dimensional spaces of test functions in the weak formulation of partial differential equations. In particular, the test functions used in isogeometric analysis are obtained by composing the inverse of the domain parameterization with the NURBS basis functions. In the case of singular parameterizations, however, some of the resulting test functions do not necessarily fulfill the required regularity properties. Consequently, numerical methods for the solution of partial differential equations cannot be applied properly.We discuss the regularity properties of the test functions. For one- and two-dimensional domains we consider several important classes of singularities of NURBS parameterizations. For specific cases we derive additional conditions which guarantee the regularity of the test functions. In addition we present a modification scheme for the discretized function space in case of insufficient regularity. It is also shown how these results can be applied for computational domains in higher dimensions that can be parameterized via sweeping.","['CAD models', 'consider several important classes of singularities of NURBS parameterizations', 'derive additional conditions which guarantee the regularity of the test functions', 'discretized function space', 'discuss the regularity properties of the test functions', 'formulation of partial differential equations', 'Galerkin projection', 'IGA', 'isogeometric analysis', 'Isogeometric analysis', 'modification scheme', 'numerical methods', 'numerical simulation method', 'NURBS', 'NURBS-based representation', 'NURBS-based representation of CAD models', 'NURBS basis functions', 'NURBS objects', 'NURBS surfaces', 'NURBS volumes', 'parameterized', 'physical domain is parameterized', 'present a modification scheme', 'splitting', 'sweeping']","[""Isogeometric analysis (IGA)"", ""NURBS-based representation of CAD models"", ""tensor-product structure of 2- or 3-dimensional NURBS objects"", ""physical domain parameterized with respect to a rectangle or cube"", ""singularly parameterized NURBS surfaces and NURBS volumes"", ""represent non-quadrangular or non-hexahedral domains without splitting"", ""compact and convenient representation"", ""Galerkin projection"", ""finite-dimensional spaces of test functions"", ""weak formulation of partial differential equations"", ""test functions obtained by composing the inverse of the domain parameterization with NURBS basis functions"", ""singular parameterizations"", ""regularity properties of test functions"", ""one- and two-dimensional domains"", ""important classes of singularities of NURBS parameterizations"", ""specific cases"", ""additional conditions"", ""guarantee the regularity of test functions"", ""modification scheme for the discretized function space"", ""insufficient regularity"", ""higher dimensions"", ""computational domains"", ""sweeping""]",Isogeometric analysis (IGA) <SEP> NURBS-based representation of CAD models <SEP> tensor-product structure of 2- or 3-dimensional NURBS objects <SEP> physical domain parameterized with respect to a rectangle or a cube <SEP> singularly parameterized NURBS surfaces and NURBS volumes <SEP> non-quadrangular or non-hexahedral domains <SEP> Galerkin projection <SEP> finite-dimensional spaces of test functions <SEP> weak formulation of partial differential equations <SEP> test functions obtained by composing the inverse of the domain parameterization with NURBS basis functions <SEP> singular parameterizations <SEP> regularity properties of test functions <SEP> one- and two-dimensional domains <SEP> classes of singularities of NURBS parameterizations <SEP> specific cases <SEP> additional conditions <SEP> modification scheme for the discretized function space <SEP> insufficient regularity <SEP> computational domains in higher dimensions <SEP> parameterized via sweeping.,"* Isogeometric analysis (IGA)

S0045782513001473,"In this paper, however, we prefer the simpler ‘framed’ cell employed by Hadjiconstantinou and Patera [16], where the shear stress is generated by constraining the velocity in a ‘frame’ rather than by modifying the shape of the box. The framed cell is periodic, but we cannot simply calculate the average stress in the whole box because the presence of an external buffer would produce spurious results. We need the local stress in the core region, but this complicates the Oij term in Eq. (3). There are other methods to calculate the stress tensor such as the method of planes [32], the volume-average approach [26,14], or the method derived from the Schweitz virial relation [25], but, in general, we must choose between a complicated computational cell (i.e. Lees–Edwards cell) and simplifying the calculation of the momentum flux, or a simple cell (i.e. framed cell) and complicating the calculation of the momentum flux.

S0021999116303291,"DPD was first proposed in order to recover the properties of isotropy (and Galilean invariance) that were broken in the so-called lattice-gas automata method [5]. In DPD, each body is regarded as a coarse-grained particle. These particles interact in a soft (and short-ranged) potential, allowing larger integration timesteps than would be possible in MD, while simultaneously decreasing the number of degrees of freedom required. As in Langevin dynamics, a thermostat consisting of well-balanced damping and stochastic terms is applied to each particle. However, unlike in Langevin dynamics, both terms are pairwise and the damping term is based on relative velocities, leading to the conservation of both the angular momentum and the linear momentum. The property of Galilean invariance (i.e., the dependence on the relative velocity) makes DPD a profile-unbiased thermostat (PUT) [6,7] by construction and thus it is an ideal thermostat for nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) [8]. The momentum is expected to propagate locally (while global momentum is conserved) and thus the correct hydrodynamics is expected in DPD [8], as demonstrated previously in [9]. Due to the aforementioned properties, DPD has been widely used to recover thermodynamic, dynamical, and rheological properties of complex fluids, with applications in polymer solutions [10], colloidal suspensions [11], multiphase flows [12], and biological systems [13]. DPD has been compared with Langevin dynamics for out-of-equilibrium simulations of polymeric systems in [14], where as expected the correct dynamic fluctuations of the polymers were obtained with the former but not with the latter.","['angular momentum', 'biological systems', 'coarse-grained particle', 'colloidal suspensions', 'complex fluids', 'dependence on the relative velocity', 'DPD', 'dynamic fluctuations', 'Galilean invariance', 'isotropy', 'Langevin dynamics', 'lattice-gas automata', 'linear momentum', 'MD', 'multiphase flows', 'NEMD', 'nonequilibrium molecular dynamics', 'nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD)', 'particles', 'polymeric systems', 'polymers', 'polymer solutions', 'profile-unbiased thermostat', 'PUT', 'recover thermodynamic, dynamical, and rheological properties', 'thermostat']","[""DPD"", ""proposed"", ""isotropy"", ""Galilean invariance"", ""lattice-gas automata method"", ""coarse-grained particle"", ""soft potential"", ""integration timesteps"", ""MD"", ""degrees of freedom"", ""Langevin dynamics"", ""thermostat"", ""damping terms"", ""stochastic terms"", ""angular momentum"", ""linear momentum"", ""Galilean invariance (PUT)"", ""nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD)"", ""momentum propagation"", ""hydrodynamics"", ""complex fluids"", ""polymer solutions"", ""colloidal suspensions"", ""multiphase flows"", ""biological systems"", ""comparison"", ""Langevin dynamics"", ""out-of-equilibrium simulations"", ""polymeric systems""]","DPD proposed for isotropy and Galilean invariance recovery <SEP>

S0045782512000266,"In this work, a numerical strategy for designing an optimal maintenance scheduling for a structure, accounting explicitly for the effects of uncertainty is suggested. This contribution, which can be regarded as an extension of the methods developed in [23], presents several novel aspects over similar approaches proposed in the literature. Firstly, the initiation and propagation of fatigue crack is modeled efficiently by means of cohesive zone elements [24–26]. The application of this class of elements allows modeling the crack initiation and propagation within a unified framework. It should be noted that cohesive zone elements have already been used for uncertainty quantification of the crack propagation phenomenon [27,28]. However its application within the context of maintenance scheduling constitutes a novelty. The second innovative aspect of this contribution refers to the assessment of the reliability sensitivity with respect to the variables that define the maintenance scheduling. The estimation of this sensitivity, which is required in order to determine the optimal maintenance schedule within the proposed framework, can be quite demanding as the model characterizing repair of a cracked structure leads to a discontinuous performance function associated with the failure probability. A new approach for modeling this function is proposed herein. The continuous and discontinuous parts respectively of the function are considered separately to estimate accurately the gradients of the failure events.","['accounting explicitly for the effects of uncertainty', 'assessment of the reliability sensitivity with respect to the variables that define the maintenance scheduling', 'class of elements', 'cohesive zone elements', 'continuous and discontinuous parts', 'discontinuous performance function associated with the failure probability', 'estimate accurately the gradients of the failure events', 'estimation of this sensitivity', 'initiation and propagation of fatigue crack', 'maintenance scheduling', 'model characterizing repair of a cracked structure', 'modeling the crack initiation and propagation within a unified framework', 'numerical strategy', 'optimal maintenance schedule within the proposed framework', 'optimal maintenance scheduling for a structure', 'uncertainty quantification of the crack propagation phenomenon', 'unified framework']","[""optimal maintenance scheduling"", ""structure"", ""uncertainty"", ""initiation and propagation of fatigue crack"", ""cohesive zone elements"", ""crack initiation and propagation"", ""unified framework"", ""uncertainty quantification of crack propagation"", ""maintenance scheduling context"", ""reliability sensitivity"", ""variables defining maintenance scheduling"", ""estimation of sensitivity"", ""optimal maintenance schedule"", ""discontinuous performance function"", ""failure probability"", ""new approach"", ""continuous and discontinuous parts"", ""gradients of failure events""]","Optimal maintenance scheduling for a structure <SEP>

S0021999115008207,"Multi-phase flows are common, in fact quite general, in environmental and industrial processes. Broadly these may be modelled as continuous problems where phases are mixed (e.g. oil–water homogenisation [36], sediment transport [18]) or interface problems where phases are distinct and interact at the interface (e.g. gas-assisted injection moulding [21], liquid jet breakup [40]). In some cases flows start as interface problems but as mixing occurs at the interface they become effectively continuous, at least locally. Air entrainment, perhaps due to wave breaking, is an obvious example. We consider here two-phase interface problems where the interface remains distinct and the density difference is high, e.g. air and water, and where one phase may be considered incompressible.

S0370269304008494,"One major goal of current nuclear physics is the observation of at least partial restoration of chiral symmetry. Since the chiral order parameter 〈q̄q〉 is expected to decrease by about 30% already at normal nuclear matter density [1–4], any in-medium change due to the dropping quark condensate should in principle be observable in photonuclear reactions. The conjecture that such a partial restoration of chiral symmetry causes a softening and narrowing of the σ meson as the chiral partner of the pion in the nuclear medium [5,6] has led to the idea of measuring the π0π0 invariant mass distribution near the 2π threshold in photon induced reactions on nuclei [7]. In contrast to its questionable nature as a proper quasiparticle in vacuum, the σ meson might develop a much narrower peak at finite baryon density due to phase-space suppression for the σ→ππ decay, hence making it possible to explore its properties when embedded in a nuclear many-body system [8–11]. Measuring a threshold enhancement of the π0π0 invariant mass spectrum might serve as a signal for the partial restoration of chiral symmetry inside nuclei and, therefore, give information about one of the most fundamental features of QCD.","['chiral order parameter', 'chiral partner', 'Measuring a threshold enhancement of the π0π0 invariant mass spectrum', 'measuring the π0π0 invariant mass distribution', 'nuclear many-body system', 'nuclear matter', 'nuclear medium', 'nuclear physics', 'nuclei', 'observation of at least partial restoration of chiral symmetry', 'partial restoration of chiral symmetry', 'photon', 'photon induced reactions', 'photonuclear reactions', 'pion', 'QCD', 'q̄q', 'quark condensate', 'quasiparticle', 'σ meson', 'σ→ππ decay']","[""chiral symmetry"", ""observation of partial restoration"", ""normal nuclear matter density"", ""in-medium change"", ""dropping quark condensate"", ""photonuclear reactions"", ""σ meson"", ""chiral partner of pion"", ""π0π0 invariant mass distribution"", ""photon induced reactions on nuclei"", ""finite baryon density"", ""phase-space suppression"", ""σ→ππ decay"", ""narrower peak"", ""explore properties"", ""nuclear many-body system"", ""threshold enhancement"", ""partial restoration of chiral symmetry"", ""QCD"", ""fundamental features""]",One major goal of current nuclear physics<SEP> observation of partial restoration of chiral symmetry<SEP> chiral order parameter <〈q̄q〉><SEP> decreases by about 30% at normal nuclear matter density<1–4><SEP> in-medium change<SEP> dropping quark condensate<SEP> photonuclear reactions<SEP> softening and narrowing of the σ meson<SEP> chiral partner of the pion<SEP> nuclear medium<SEP> π0π0 invariant mass distribution<SEP> near 2π threshold<SEP> photon induced reactions on nuclei<7><SEP> questionable nature as a proper quasiparticle in vacuum<SEP> much narrower peak at finite baryon density<SEP> phase-space suppression<SEP> σ→ππ decay<SEP> exploring properties of σ meson<SEP> nuclear many-body system<8–11><SEP> threshold enhancement<SEP> partial restoration of chiral symmetry inside nuclei<SEP> fundamental features of QCD.,"* partial restoration of chiral symmetry

S0009261415001517,"Since the receptors in human biology mostly consist of chiral molecules, drug action mostly involves a specified enantiomeric form. This has spurred the development, especially in the pharmaceutical industry, of a host of techniques to secure enantiopure products. Such methods, mostly multi-step and time-consuming, can typically be cast in one of two distinct categories: synthetic mechanisms designed to produce a single stereoisomer, or separation techniques to isolate distinct enantiomers from a racemic mixture. A significant drawback, for either approach, is a dependence on a supply of enantiopure reagents or substrates – synthesis routes generally utilise chiral building blocks or enantioselective catalysts [7,8], while enantiomer separation techniques typically incorporate chiral selector molecules to form chemically distinct and distinguishable diastereomeric complexes [8,9]. A key requirement in aiming to achieve enantiopure products, irrespective of the synthetic method, is therefore a means to measure, and duly quantitate the enantiomeric excess – signifying the degree of chirality within molecular products. Chiral discrimination through optical means is well-known to offer direct, non-contact ways to distinguish between molecules of different handedness, based on observations such as the subtle differences in absorption of left- and right-handed circularly polarised light, or indeed the twisting of polarisation in optical rotation. Other optical methods, under more recent development, also show some promise to achieve enantiomer separation, as will be introduced later.","['absorption', 'achieve enantiopure products, irrespective of the synthetic method', 'chiral building blocks', 'Chiral discrimination', 'chiral molecules', 'chiral selector molecules', 'degree of chirality', 'diastereomeric complexes', 'echniques to secure enantiopure products', 'enantiomeric excess', 'enantiomers', 'enantiomer separation', 'enantiomer separation techniques', 'enantiopure products', 'enantiopure reagents or substrates', 'enantioselective catalysts', 'means to measure, and duly quantitate the enantiomeric excess', 'methods, mostly multi-step and time-consuming', 'molecular products', 'molecules', 'optical means', 'optical methods', 'separation techniques', 'stereoisomer', 'synthesis routes', 'synthetic mechanisms', 'synthetic method', 'twisting of polarisation in optical rotation']","[""human biology"", ""chiral molecules"", ""drug action"", ""enantiomeric form"", ""enantiopure products"", ""techniques"", ""multi-step"", ""time-consuming"", ""synthetic mechanisms"", ""stereoisomer"", ""separation techniques"", ""racemic mixture"", ""enantiopure reagents"", ""substrates"", ""chiral building blocks"", ""enantioselective catalysts"", ""chiral selector molecules"", ""diastereomeric complexes"", ""enantiomeric excess"", ""chirality"", ""molecular products"", ""chiral discrimination"", ""optical means"", ""absorption"", ""left-handed circularly polarised light"", ""right-handed circularly polarised light"", ""twisting of polarisation"", ""optical rotation"", ""other optical methods""]",human biology <SEP> chiral molecules <SEP> drug action <SEP> specified enantiomeric form <SEP> enantiopure products <SEP> techniques <SEP> multi-step <SEP> time-consuming <SEP> synthetic mechanisms <SEP> single stereoisomer <SEP> chiral building blocks <SEP> enantioselective catalysts <SEP> enantiomer separation techniques <SEP> racemic mixture <SEP> chiral selector molecules <SEP> diastereomeric complexes <SEP> enantiomeric excess <SEP> chirality <SEP> optical means <SEP> non-contact <SEP> absorption <SEP> left- and right-handed circularly polarised light <SEP> twisting of polarisation <SEP> optical rotation <SEP> other optical methods <SEP> enantiomer separation.,"* human biology mostly consists of chiral molecules
